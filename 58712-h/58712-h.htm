      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "Girls, I have some great news for you. I'm sure you'll be interested, and
      I hope you'll be as delighted as I am. Come on, all of you. Gather around
      in a circle just as if we were going to have a Council Fire and I'll tell
      you something that will-that will-Teddy Bear your teeth."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A chorus of laughter, just a little derisive, greeted Katherine Crane's
      enigmatical figure of speech. The merriment came from eleven members of
      Flamingo Camp Fire, who proceeded to form an arc of a circle in front of
      the speaker on the hillside grass plot near the white canvas tents of the
      girls' camp.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What does it mean to Teddy Bear your teeth?" inquired Julietta Hyde with
      mock impatience. "Come, Katherine, you are as much of a problem with your
      ideas as Harriet Newcomb is with her big words. Do you know the nicknames
      some of us are thinking of giving to her?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>"No, what is it?" Katherine
      asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Polly."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Polly? Why Polly?" was the next question of the user of obscure figures
      of speech, who seemed by this time to have forgotten the subject that she
      started to introduce when she opened the conversation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Polly Syllable, of course," Julietta answered, and the burst of laughter
      that followed would have been enough to silence the most ambitious joker,
      but this girl fun-maker was not in the least ambitious, so she laughed
      appreciatively with the others.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, anyway," she declared after the merriment had subsided; "Harriet
      always uses her polysyllables correctly, so I am not in the least offended
      at your comparison of my obscurities with her profundities. There, how's
      that? Don't you think you'd better call me Polly, too?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not till you explain to us what it means to Teddy Bear one's teeth,"
      Azalia Atwood stipulated sternly. "What I'm afraid of is that you're
      trying to introduce politics into this club, and we won't stand for that a
      minute."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, yes, Julietta, you may have your wish, if what Azalia says is true,"
      Marie Crismore announced so eagerly that everybody present knew that she
      had an idea and waited expectantly for it to come out. "We'll call you
      Polly-Polly Tix."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Of course everybody laughed at this, and <span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>then
      Harriet Newcomb demanded, that her rival for enigmatical honors make good.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What does it mean to Teddy Bear one's teeth?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, you girls are making too much of that remark," Katherine protested
      modestly. "I really am astonished at every one of you, ashamed of you, in
      fact, for failing to get me. I meant that you would be
      delighted-dee-light-ed-get me?-dee-light-ed."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, I get you," Helen Nash announced, lifting her hand over her head with
      an "I know, teacher," attitude.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, Helen, get up and speak your piece," Katherine directed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You referred to the way Theodore Roosevelt shows his teeth when he says
      he's "dee-light-ed"; but we got you wrong. When you said you would tell us
      something that would 'Teddy Bear' our teeth, you meant b-a-r-e, not
      b-e-a-r. When Teddy laughs, he bares his teeth. Isn't that it?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "This isn't the first time that Helen Nash has proved herself a regular
      Sherlock Holmes," Marion Stanlock declared enthusiastically. "We are
      pretty well equipped with brains in this camp, I want to tell you. We have
      Harriet, the walking dictionary; Katherine, the girl enigma; and Helen,
      the detective."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Every girl is supposed to be a puzzle," Ernestine Johanson reminded. "I
      don't like to snatch any honors away from anyone, but, <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_12">12</span>you know, we should always have the truth."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, let us have the truth about this interesting, Teddy-teeth-baring,
      dee-light-ing announcement that Katherine has to make to us," Estelle
      Adler implored.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The delay wasn't my fault," Katherine said, with an attitude of "perfect
      willingness if all this nonsense will stop." "But here comes Miss Ladd.
      Let's wait for her to join us, for I know you will all want her opinion of
      the proposition I am going to put to you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Miss Harriet Ladd, Guardian of the Fire, bearing a large bouquet of wild
      flowers that she had just gathered in timber and along the bank of the
      stream, joined the group of girls seated on the grass a minute later, and
      then all waited expectantly for Katherine to begin.

        CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A SPECIAL MEETING CALLED.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Fern hollow-begging the indulgence of those who have read the earlier
      volume of this series-is a deep, richly vegetated ravine or gully forming
      one of a series of scenic convolutions of the surface of the earth which
      gave the neighboring town of Fairberry a wide reputation as a place of
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The thirteen Camp Fire Girls, who had pitched their tents on the lower
      hillside, a few hundred feet from a boisterous, gravel-and-boulder bedded
      stream known as Butter creek, were students at Hiawatha Institute, a
      girls' school in a neighboring state. The students of that school were all
      Camp Fire Girls, and it was not an uncommon thing for individual Fires to
      spend parts of their vacations together at favorite camping places. On the
      present occasion the members of Flamingo Fire were guests of one of their
      own number, Hazel Edwards, on the farm of the latter's aunt, Mrs. Hannah
      Hutchins, which included a considerable section of the scenic Ravine known
      as Fern hollow.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They had had some startling adventures in the last few weeks, and although
      several days had elapsed since the windup in these events and it seemed
      that a season of quiet, peaceful camp life was in store for them, still
      they were <span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>sufficiently keyed up
      to the unusual in life to accept surprises and astonishing climaxes as
      almost matters of course.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But all of these experiences had not rendered them restless and
      discontented when events slowed down to the ordinary course of every-day
      life, including three meals a day, eight hours' sleep, and a program of
      tramps, exercises and honor endeavors. The girls were really glad to
      return to their schedule and their handbook for instructions as to how
      they should occupy their time. After all, adventures make entertaining
      reading, but very few, if any, persons normally constituted would choose a
      melodramatic career if offered as an alternative along with an even-tenor
      existence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All within one week, these girls had witnessed the execution of an
      astonishing plot by a band of skilled lawbreakers and subsequently had
      followed Mrs. Hutchins through a series of experiences relative to the
      loss of a large amount of property, which she held in trust for a relative
      of her late husband, and its recovery through the brilliant and energetic
      endeavors of some of the members of the Camp Fire, particularly Hazel
      Edwards and Harriet Newcomb. The chief culprit, Percy Teich, a nephew of
      Mrs. Hutchins' late husband, had been captured, had escaped, had been
      captured again and lodged in jail, and clews as to the identity of a
      number of the rest had been worked out by the police, so <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>that the hope was expressed
      confidently that eventually they, too, would be caught.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Mrs. Hutchins is very grateful for the part this Camp Fire took in the
      recovery of the lost securities of which she was trustee," Katherine
      announced by way of introducing her "great news" to the members of the
      Fire who assembled in response to her call. "Of course Hazel did the
      really big things, assisted and encouraged by the companionship of Harriet
      and Violet, but Mrs. Hutchins feels like thanking us all for being here
      and looking pleasant."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hazel Edwards, niece of Mrs. Hutchins, was not present during this
      conversation. By prearranged purpose, she was absent from the camp when
      Katherine put to the other girls the proposition made by the wealthy aunt
      of their girl hostess. The reason it was decided best for her to remain
      away while the other girls were considering the plan was that it was
      feared that her presence might tend to suppress arguments against its
      acceptance, and that was a possibility which Hazel and her aunt wished to
      avoid. So Katherine was selected to lay the matter before the Camp Fire
      because she was no more chummy with Hazel than any of the other girls.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let's make this a special business meeting," suggested Miss Ladd, who had
      already discussed the proposition with Katherine and Mrs. Hutchins. "What
      Katherine has to say interests you as an organization. You'd have <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>to bring the matter up at a business
      meeting anyway to take action on it and our regular one is two weeks
      ahead. We can't wait that long if we are going to do anything on the
      subject."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was a little after 10 o'clock and the girls had been working for the
      last hour at various occupations which appeared on their several routine
      schedules for this part of the day. In fact, all of their regular academic
      and hand-work study hours were in the morning. Just before Katherine
      called the girls together, they were seated here and there in shaded spots
      on camp chairs or on the grass in the vicinity of the camp, occupied thus:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Violet Munday and Marie Crismore were studying the lives of well-known
      Indians. Julietta Hyde and Estelle Adler were reading a book of Indian
      legends and making a study of Indian symbols. Harriet Newcomb and Azalia
      Atwood were studying the Camp Fire hand-sign language. Ernestine Johanson
      and Ethel Zimmerman were crocheting some luncheon sets. Ruth Hazelton and
      Helen Nash were mending their ceremonial gowns. Marion Stanlock was making
      a beaded head band and Katherine Crane, secretary of the Fire, was looking
      over the minutes of the last meeting and preparing a new book in which to
      enter the records of the next meeting.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Everybody signifying assent to the Guardian's suggestion, a meeting was
      declared and called to order, the Wohelo Song was sung, <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>the roll was called, the minutes of
      the last meeting were read, the reports of the treasurer and committees
      were deferred, as were also the recording of honors in the Record Book and
      the decorating of the count, and then the Guardian called for new
      business. This was the occasion for Katherine to address the meeting
      formally on the matter she had in mind.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "Now," said Katherine after all the preliminaries of a business meeting
      had been gone through, "I'll begin all over again, so that this whole
      proceeding may be thoroughly regular. I admit I went at it rather
      spasmodically, but you know we girls are constituted along sentimental
      lines, and that is one of the handicaps we are up against in our efforts
      to develop strong-willed characters like those of men."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't agree with you," Marie Crismore put in with a rather saucy pout.
      "I don't believe we are built along sentimental lines at all. I've known
      lots of men-boys-a few, I mean-and have heard of many more who were just
      as sentimental as the most sentimental girl."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There were several half-suppressed titters in the semicircle of Camp Fire
      Girls before whom Katherine stood as she began her address. Marie was an
      unusually pretty girl, a fact which of itself was quite enough to arouse
      the humor of laughing eyes when she commented on the sentimentality of the
      opposite sex. Moreover, her evident confusion as she tangled herself up,
      in her efforts to avoid personal embarrassment, was exceedingly amusing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I would suggest, Katherine," Miss Ladd interposed, <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_19">19</span>"that you be careful to make your statement simple
      and direct and not say anything that is likely to start an argument. If
      you will do that we shall be able to get through much more rapidly and
      more satisfactorily."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine accepted this as good advice and continued along the lines
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, the main facts are these," she said; "Mrs. Hutchins has learned
      that the child whose property she holds in trust is not being cared for
      and treated as one would expect a young heir to be treated, and something
      like $3,000 a year is being paid to the people who have him in charge for
      his support and education. The people who have him in charge get this
      money in monthly installments and make no report to anybody as to the
      welfare of their ward.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The name of this young heir is Glen Irving. He is a son of Mrs. Hutchins'
      late husband's nephew. When Glen's father died he left most of his
      property in trust for the boy and made Mr. Hutchins trustee, and when Mr.
      Hutchins died, the trusteeship passed on to Mrs. Hutchins under the terms
      of the will.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That, you girls know, is the property which was lost for a year and a
      half following Mr. Hutchins' death because he had hidden the securities
      where they could not be found. Although Hazel, no doubt assisted very much
      by Harriet, is really the one who discovered those securities and returned
      them <span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>to her aunt, still Mrs.
      Hutchins seems disposed to give us all some of the credit.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "For several months reports have reached Mrs. Hutchins that her
      grandnephew has not been receiving the best of care from the relatives who
      have charge of him. She has tried in various ways to find out how much
      truth there was in these reports, but was unsuccessful. Little Glen, who
      is only 10 years old, has been in the charge of an uncle and aunt on his
      mother's side ever since he became an orphan three or four years ago. His
      father, in his will, named this uncle and aunt as Glen's caretakers, but
      privately executed another instrument in which he gave Mr. and Mrs.
      Hutchins guardianship powers to supervise the welfare of little Glen. It
      was understood that these powers were not to be exercised unless special
      conditions made it necessary for them to step in and take charge of the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Mrs. Hutchins wants to find out now whether such conditions exist. At the
      time of the death of Glen's father, he lived in Baltimore, and his uncle
      and aunt, who took charge of him, lived there, too. It seems that they
      were only moderately well-to-do and the $3,000 a year they got for the
      care and education of the boy was a boon to them. Of course, $3,000 a year
      was more than was needed, but that was the provision made by his father in
      his will, and as long as they had possession of the boy they were entitled
      to the <span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>money. Moreover, Mrs.
      Hutchins understands that Glen's father desired to pay the caretakers of
      his child so well that there could be no doubt that he would get the best
      of everything he needed, particularly education.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But apparently his father made a big mistake in selecting the persons who
      were to take the places of father and mother to the little boy. If reports
      are true, they have been using most of the money on themselves and their
      own children and Glen has received but indifferent clothes, care, and
      education. Now I am coming to the main point of my statement to you.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Mrs. Hutchins talked the matter over with Miss Ladd and me and asked us
      to put it up to you in this way: She was wondering if we wouldn't like to
      make a trip to the place where Glen is living and find out how he is
      treated. Mrs. Hutchins has an idea that we are a pretty clever set of
      girls and there is no use of trying to argue her out of it. So that much
      must be agreed to so far as she is concerned. She wants to pay all of our
      expenses and has worked out quite an elaborate plan; or rather she and her
      lawyer worked it out together. Really, it is very interesting."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why, she wants us to be real detectives," exclaimed Violet Munday
      excitedly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No, don't put it that way," Julietta Hyde objected. "Just say she wants
      us to take the parts of fourteen Lady Sherlock Holmeses in a Juvenile
      drama in real life."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>"Very cleverly expressed," Miss
      Ladd remarked admiringly. "Detective is entirely too coarse a term to
      apply to any of my Camp Fire Girls and I won't stand for it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We might call ourselves special agents, operatives, secret emissaries, or
      mystery probers," Harriet Newcomb suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, we could expect something like that from our walking dictionary,"
      said Ernestine Johanson. "But whatever we call ourselves, I am ready to
      vote aye. Come on with your-or Mrs. Hutchins and her lawyers'-plan,
      Katherine. I'm impatient to hear the rest of it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine produced an envelope from her middy-blouse pocket and drew from
      it a folded paper, which she unfolded and spread out before her.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "Before I take up the plan outlined by Mrs. Hutchins and her lawyer,"
      Katherine continued, as she unfolded the paper, "I want to explain one
      circumstance that might be confusing if left unexplained. As I said, the
      uncle and aunt who have Glen in charge live in Baltimore. They do not own
      any real estate, but rent a rather expensive apartment, which they never
      could support on the family income aside from the monthly payments
      received from Mrs. Hutchins as trustee of Glen's estate. This family's
      name is Graham, and its head, James Graham, is a bookkeeper receiving a
      salary of about $1,800 a year. In these war times, when the cost of living
      is so high, that is a very moderate salary on which to support a family of
      six: father, mother, two girls and two boys, including Glen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But this family, according to reports that have reached Mrs. Hutchins, is
      living in clover. Mr. Graham, who is a hard working man, still holds his
      bookkeeping position, but in this instance it is a case of 'everybody
      loafs but father.' He is said to be a very much henpecked husband. Mrs.
      Graham is said to be the financial dictator of the family.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, Mrs. Graham seems to be a woman of much social ambition. Among the
      necessaries of the best social equipment, you know, <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_24">24</span>is a summer cottage in a society summer resort with
      sufficient means to support it respectably and leisure in the summer to
      spend at the resort. It is said that the Grahams have all this. They have
      purchased or leased a cottage at Twin Lakes, which you know is only about
      a hundred miles from Hiawatha Institute. I think that every one of us has
      been there at one time or another. It is about three hundred miles from
      here.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What Mrs. Hutchins wants us to do is to make a trip to Twin Lakes, pitch
      our tents and start a Camp Fire program just as if we were there to put in
      a season of recreation and honor work. But meanwhile, she wants us to
      become acquainted with the Graham family, cultivate an intimacy with them,
      if you please, and be able to report back to her just what conditions we
      find in their family circle, just how Glen is treated, and whether or not
      he gets reasonable benefits from the money given to the Grahams for his
      support and education.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I have given you in detail, I think, what is outlined on this paper I
      hold in my hand. I don't think I have left out anything except the names
      of the children of the Graham family. But there are no names at all on
      this paper. The reason for this is that it was thought best not to
      disclose the identity of the family for the information of any other
      person into whose hands it might fall, if it should be lost by us. The
      names are indicated thus: <span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>'A'
      stands for the oldest member of the family, Mrs. Graham, for she is two
      years older than her husband and the real head of the household; 'B'
      stands for the next younger, Mr. Graham; 'C' stands for Addie, the oldest
      daughter; 'D' for the next daughter, Olga; 'E' for the only son, James,
      named after his father; and 'F' stands for Glen. There, you have the whole
      proposition. What do you want to do with it? Mrs. Hutchins, I neglected to
      mention, wants to pay all of our expenses and hire help to take off our
      hands all the labor of moving our camp."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Replies were not slow coming. Nearly every one of the girls had something
      to say, as indicated by the eager attitudes of all and requests from
      several to be recognized by the Guardian, who was "in the chair." Azalia
      Atwood was the first one called upon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think the proposition of Mrs. Hutchins is simply great," the latter
      declared with vim. "It's delightfully romantic, sounds like a story with a
      plot, and would make fourteen heroines out of us if we were successful in
      our mission."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I want to warn you against one danger," Miss Ladd interposed at this
      point. "The natural thing for you to do at the start, after hearing this
      lengthy indictment of the Graham family, is to conclude that they are a
      bad lot and to feel an eagerness to set out to prove it. Now, I admit that
      that is my feeling in this matter, but I know also that there is a <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>possibility of mistake. The Grahams
      may be high class people, but they may have enemies who are trying to
      injure them. If you take up the proposition of Mrs. Hutchins, you must
      keep this possibility in mind, for unless you do, you might do not only
      the Grahams a great injustice, but little Glen as well. It would be a pity
      to tear him away from a perfectly good home that has been vilified by
      false accusations made by unscrupulous enemies."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The discussion was continued for nearly an hour, the written instructions
      in Katherine's possession were read aloud and then a vote was taken. It
      was unanimous, in favor of performing the task proposed by Mrs. Hutchins.

    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "Why couldn't this expedition be arranged so that we girls could all win
      some honors out of it?" Ruth Hazelton inquired, after the details of Mrs.
      Hutchins' plan had been discussed thoroughly and the vote had been taken.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That is a good suggestion," said Miss Ladd. "What kind of honors would
      you propose Ruth?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter was silent for some minutes. She was going over in her mind the
      list of home-craft, health-craft, camp-craft, hand-craft, nature-lore,
      business and patriotism honors provided for by the organization, but none
      of them seemed to fit in with the program of the proposed secret
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't think of any," she said at last. "There aren't any, are there?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No, there are not," the Guardian replied. "But now is the time for the
      exercise of a little ingenuity. Who speaks first with an idea?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I have one," announced Ethel Zimmerman eagerly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, what is it, Ethel?" Miss Ladd inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Local honors," replied the girl with the first idea. "Each Camp Fire is
      authorized to create local honors and award special beads <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>and other emblems to those who make
      the requirements."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Under what circumstances is such a proceeding authorized?" was Miss
      Ladd's next question.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "When it is found that local conditions call for the awarding of honors
      not provided for in the elective list."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do such honors count for anything in the qualifications for higher rank?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They do not," Ethel answered like a pupil who had learned her lesson very
      well and felt no hesitancy in making her recitation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What kind of honor would you confer on me if I exhibited great skill in
      spying on someone else?" asked Helen Nash in her usual cool and deliberate
      manner.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A problematical smile lit up the faces of several of the girls who caught
      the significance of this suggestion. Miss Ladd smiled, too, but not so
      problematically.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You mean to point out the incongruity of honors and spies, I presume,"
      the Guardian interpreted, addressing Helen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not very seriously," the latter replied with an expression of dry humor.
      "I couldn't resist the temptation to ask the question and, moreover, it
      occurred to me that a little discussion on the subject of honors and spies
      might help to complete our study of the problem before us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you mean that we are going to be spies?" Violet Munday questioned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>"Why, of course we are," Helen
      replied, with a half-twinkle in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't like the idea of spying on anybody and would rather call it
      something else," said Marie Crismore. "First someone calls us detectives
      and then somebody calls us spies. What next? Ugh!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why don't you like to spy on anybody?" asked Harriet Newcomb.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well," Marie answered hesitatingly; "you know that there are thousands of
      foreign spies in this country trying to help our enemies in Europe, and I
      don't like to be classed with them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's patriotic," said Helen, the twinkle in her eyes becoming brighter.
      "But you must remember that there are spies and spies, good spies and bad
      spies. All of our law-enforcement officials are spies in their attempts to
      crush crime. Your mother was a spy when she watched you as a little tot
      stealing into the pantry to poke your fist into the jam. That is what Mrs.
      Hutchins suspects is taking place now. Someone has got his or her fist in
      the jam. We must go and peek in through the pantry door."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, if you put it that way, it'll be lots of fun," Marie exclaimed
      eagerly. "I'd just like to catch 'em with their fists all-all-smeared!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She brought the last word out so ecstatically that everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm afraid you have fallen into the pit that <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_30">30</span>I warned you against," Miss Ladd said, addressing
      Marie. "You mustn't start out eager to prove the persons, under suspicion,
      guilty."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Then we must drive out of our minds the picture of the fists smeared with
      jam," deplored Marie with a playful pout.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I fear that you must," was the smiling concurrence of the Guardian.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Very well; I'm a good soldier," said Marie, straightening up as if ready
      to "shoulder arms." "I won't imagine any jam until I see it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Here comes Hazel," cried Julietta, and everybody looked in the direction
      indicated.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hazel Edwards had taken advantage of this occasion to go to her aunt's
      house and thence to the city Red Cross headquarters for a new supply of
      yarn for their army and navy knitting. As she emerged from the timber and
      continued along the edge of the woods toward the site of the camp, the
      assembled campers could see that she carried a good-sized bundle under one
      arm.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "She's got some more yarn, and we can now take up our knitting again,"
      said Ethel Zimmerman, who had proved herself to be the most rapid of all
      the members of the Camp Fire with the needles.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Although the business of the meeting was finished, by tacit agreement
      those present decided not to adjourn until Hazel arrived and received
      official notice of what had been done.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm delighted with your decision," Hazel <span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>said
      eagerly. "And, do you know, I believe we are going to have some adventure.
      I've been talking the matter over with Aunt Hannah and she has told me a
      lot of very interesting things. But when do you want to go?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We haven't discussed that yet," Miss Ladd replied. "I suppose we could go
      almost any time."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let's go at once," proposed Marion Stanlock. "We haven't anything to keep
      us here and we can come back as soon as-as soon as we find the jam on
      somebody's fist."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This figure of speech called for an explanation for Hazel's benefit. Then
      Ruth Hazelton moved that the Camp Fire place itself at Mrs. Hutchins'
      service to leave for Twin Lakes as soon as she thought best, and this
      motion was carried unanimously.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I move that Katherine Crane be appointed a committee of one to notify
      Mrs. Hutchins of our action and get instructions from her for our next
      move," said Violet Munday.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Second the motion," said Azalia Atwood.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Question!" shouted Harriet Newcomb.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Those in favor say aye," said Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A hearty chorus of "ayes" was the response.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Contrary minded, no."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The ayes have it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The meeting adjourned.

    <p class="c006">
      At 9 o'clock in the morning two days later, a train of three coaches, two
      sleepers and a parlor car, pulled out of Fairberry northwest bound. It was
      a clear midsummer day, not oppressively warm. The atmosphere had been
      freshened by a generous shower of rain a few hours before sunup.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In the parlor car near one end sat a group of thirteen girls and one young
      woman. The latter, Miss Ladd, Guardian of Flamingo Camp Fire, we will
      hereafter designate as "one of the girls." She was indeed scarcely more
      than a girl, having passed her voting majority by less than a year.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The last two days had been devoted principally to preparations for this
      trip. Mrs. Hutchins had engaged two men who struck the tents and packed
      these and all the other camp paraphernalia and expressed the entire outfit
      to Twin Lakes station. On the morning before us, Mrs. Hutchins accompanied
      the fourteen girls to the train at the Fairberry depot and bade them
      good-byee and wished them success in their enterprise.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There were few other passengers in the parlor car when the Camp Fire Girls
      entered. One old gentleman obligingly moved forward from a seat at the
      rear end, and the new passengers <span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>were
      able to occupy a section all by themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Before starting for the train, Miss Ladd called her little flock of
      "spies" together and gave them a short lecture.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, girls," she said with keen deliberation, "we are about to embark on
      a venture that has in it elements which will put many of your qualities to
      severe test. And these tests are going to begin right away. Perhaps the
      first will be a test of your ability to hold your tongues. That's pretty
      hard for a bevy of girls who like to talk better than anything else, isn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you really mean to accuse us of liking to talk better than anything
      else?" inquired Marie Crismore, flushing prettily.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I didn't say so, did I?" was the Guardian's answering query.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not exactly. But you meant it, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I refuse to be pinned down to an answer," replied Miss Ladd, smiling
      enigmatically. "I suspect that if I leave you something to guess about on
      that subject it may sink in deeper. Now, can any of you surmise what
      specifically I am driving at?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nobody ventured an answer, and Miss Ladd continued:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't talk about our mission to Twin Lakes except on secret occasions.
      Don't drop remarks now and then or here and there that may be overheard
      and make someone listen <span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>for
      more. For instance, on the train, forget that you are on anything except a
      mere pleasure trip or Camp Fire excursion. Be absolutely certain that you
      don't drop any remarks that might arouse anybody's curiosity or suspicion.
      It might, you know, get to the very people whom we wish to keep in
      ignorance concerning our moves and motives."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I see you are bound to make sure enough spies out of us," said Marie
      Crismore pertly. "Well, I'm going to start out with the determination of
      pulling my hat down over my eyes, hiding in every shadow I see and peeking
      around every corner I can get to. Oh, I'm going to be some sleuth, believe
      me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What will you say when you catch somebody with jam on his fingers?"
      Harriet Newcomb inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Marie leaned forward eagerly and answered dramatically:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll suddenly appear before the villain and shout: 'Halt, you are my
      prisoner! Throw up your jammed hands!'"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After the laugh that greeted this response subsided, Miss Ladd closed her
      lecture thus:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think you all appreciate the importance now of keeping your thoughts to
      yourselves except when we are in conference. I'm glad to see you have a
      lot of fun over this subject, but don't let your gay spirits cause you to
      permit any unguarded remarks to escape."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On the train the girls all got out their knitting, and soon their needles
      were plying merrily <span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>away on
      sleeveless sweaters, socks, helmets, and wristlets for the boys at the
      front, timing their work by their wrist watches for patriotism honors.
      True to their resolve, following Miss Ladd's warning lecture, they kept
      the subject of their mission out of their conversation, and it is probable
      that no reference to it would have been made during the entire 300-mile
      journey if something had not happened which forced it keenly to the
      attention of every one of them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The train on which they were traveling was a limited and the first stop
      was fifty miles from Fairberry. A few moments after the train stopped, a
      telegraph messenger walked into the front entrance of the parlor car and
      called out:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Telegram for Miss Harriet Ladd."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter arose and received the message, signed the receipt blank, and
      tore open the envelope. Imagine her astonishment as she read the
      following:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Miss Harriet Ladd, parlor car, Pocahontas Limited: Attorney Pierce
      Langford is on your train, first coach. Bought ticket for Twin Lakes.
      Small man, squint eyes, smooth face. Watch out for him. Letter follows
      telegram, Mrs. Hannah Hutchins."
    </p>

        CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A DOUBLE-ROOM MYSTERY.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Miss Ladd passed the telegram around among the girls after writing the
      following explanation at the foot of the message:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Pierce Langford is the Fairberry attorney that represented scheming
      relatives of Mrs. Hutchins' late husband, who attempted to force money out
      of her after the disappearance of the securities belonging to Glen
      Irving's estate. Leave this matter to me and don't talk about it until we
      reach Twin Lakes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nothing further was said about the incident during the rest of the
      journey, as requested by Miss Ladd. The girls knitted, rested, chatted,
      read, and wrote a few post-cards or "train letters" to friends. But
      although there was not a word of conversation among the Camp Fire members
      relative to the passenger named in Mrs. Hutchins' telegram, yet the
      subject was not absent from their minds much of the time.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were being followed! No other construction could be put upon the
      telegram. But for what purpose? What did the unscrupulous lawyer-that was
      the way Mrs. Hutchins had once referred to Pierce Langford-have in mind to
      do? Would he make trouble for them in any way that would place them in an
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>embarrassing position? These
      girls had had experiences in the last year which were likely to make them
      apprehensive of almost anything under such circumstances as these.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Warned of the presence on the train of a probable agent of the family that
      Mrs. Hutchins had under suspicion, the girls were constantly on the alert
      for some evidence of his interest in them and their movements. And they
      were rewarded to this extent: In the course of the journey, Langford paid
      the conductor the extra mileage for parlor car privileges, and as he
      transferred from the coach, not one of the Flamingoites failed to observe
      the fact that in personal appearance he answered strikingly the
      description of the man referred to in the telegram received by Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The squint-eyed man of mystery, in the coolest and most nonchalant manner,
      took a seat a short distance in front of the bevy of knitting Camp Fire
      Girls, unfolded a newspaper and appeared to bury himself in its contents,
      oblivious to all else about him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Half an hour later he arose and left the car, passing out toward the rear
      end of the train. Another half hour elapsed and he did not reappear. Then
      Katherine Crane and Hazel Edwards put away their knitting and announced
      that they were going back into the observation car and look over the
      magazines. They did not communicate to each other their real purpose in
      making this move, but neither <span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>had
      any doubt as to what was going on in the mind of the other. Marie Crismore
      looked at them with a little squint of intelligence and said as she arose
      from her chair:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think I'll go, too, for a change."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But this is what she interpolated to herself:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They're going back there to spy, and I think I'll go and spy, too."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They found Langford in the observation car, apparently asleep in a chair.
      Katherine, who entered first, declared afterwards that she was positive
      she saw him close his eyes like a flash and lapse into an appearance of
      drowsiness, but if she was not in error, his subsequent manner was a very
      clever simulation of midday slumber. Three or four times in the course of
      the next hour he shifted his position and half opened his eyes, but
      drooped back quickly into the most comfortable appearance of somnolent
      lassitude.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The three girls were certain that all this was pure "make-believe," but
      they did not communicate their conviction to each other by look or
      suggestion of any kind. They played their part very well, and it is quite
      possible that Langford, peeking through his eyewinkers, was considerably
      puzzled by their manner. He had no reason to believe that he was known to
      them by name or reputation, much less by personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was in fact a game of spy on both sides during most of the journey,
      with little but <span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>mystifying
      results. The train reached Twin Lakes at about sundown, and even then the
      girls had discovered no positive evidence as to the "squint-eyed man's"
      purpose in taking the trip they were taking. And Langford, as he left the
      train, could not confidently say to himself that he had detected any
      suggestion of interest on their part because of his presence on the train.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Flamingo Camp Fire rode in an omnibus to the principal hotel in the town,
      the Crandell house, and were assigned to rooms on the second floor. They
      had had their supper on the train and proceeded at once to prepare for a
      night's rest. Still no words were exchanged among them relative to the
      purpose of their visit or the mysterious, squint-eyed passenger concerning
      whom all of them felt an irrepressible curiosity and not a little
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Miss Ladd occupied a room with Katherine Crane. After making a general
      survey of the floor and noting the location of the rooms of the other
      girls, they entered their own apartment and closed the door. Marie
      Crismore and Julietta Hyde occupied the room immediately south of theirs,
      but to none of them had the room immediately north been assigned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I wonder if the next room north is occupied," Katherine remarked as she
      took off her hat and laid it on a shelf in the closet.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Someone is entering now," Miss Ladd <span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>whispered,
      lifting her hand with a warning for low-toned conversation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The exchange of a few indistinct words between two persons could be heard;
      then one of them left, and the other was heard moving about in the room.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's one of the hotel men who just brought a new guest up," Katherine
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And I'm going to find out who it is," the Guardian declared in a low
      tone, turning toward the door.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll go with you," said Katherine, and together they went down to the
      office.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They sought the register at once and began looking over the list of
      arrivals. Presently Miss Ladd pointed with her finger the following
      registration:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Pierce Langford, Fairberry, Room 36."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Miss Ladd and Katherine occupied Room 35.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Anything you wish, ladies?" asked the proprietor, who stood behind the
      desk.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes," Miss Ladd answered. "We want another room."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll have to give you single rooms, if that one is not satisfactory," was
      the reply. "All my double rooms are filled."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Isn't 36 a double room?" Katherine inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, but it's occupied. I just sent a man up there."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Excuse the question," Miss Ladd said curiously; <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_41">41</span>"but why did you put one person in a double room
      when it was the only double room you had and there were vacant single
      rooms in the house?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The hotel keeper smiled pleasantly, as if the question was the simplest in
      the world to answer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Because he insisted on having it and paid me double rate in advance," was
      the landlord's startling reply.
    </p>

        CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class="c002">PLANNING IN SECRET.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Without a word of comment relative to this remarkable information, Miss
      Ladd turned and started back upstairs, and Katherine followed. In the hall
      at the upper landing, the Guardian whispered thus in the ear of her
      roommate:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Sh! Don't say a word or commit an act that could arouse suspicion. He's
      probably listening, or looking, or both. Just forget this subject and talk
      about the new middy-blouse you are making, or something like that. Don't
      gush, either, or he may suspect your motive. We want to throw him off the
      track if possible."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But Katherine preferred to say little, for she was tired, and made haste
      to get into bed. It was not long before the subject of their plans and
      problems and visions of spies and "jam-stained fists" were lost in the
      lethe of dreamland.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were awakened in the morning by the first breakfast bell and arose at
      once. They dressed hurriedly and went at once to the dining-room, where
      they found two of the girls ahead of them. The others appeared presently.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As the second bell rang, Pierce Langford sauntered into the room and took
      a seat near <span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>the table occupied
      by Helen Nash and Violet Munday. He looked about him in a half-vacant
      inconsequential way and then began to "jolly" the waitress, who approached
      and sung off a string of alternates on the "Hooverized" bill of fare which
      she carried in her mind. She coldly ignored his "jollies," for it was
      difficult for Langford to be pleasing even when he tried to be pleasant,
      took his order, and proceeded on her way.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girls paid no further attention to the supposed spy-lawyer during
      breakfast, and the latter appeared to pay no further attention to them.
      After the meal, Miss Ladd called the girls together and suggested that
      they take a walk. Then she dismissed them to prepare. Twenty minutes later
      they reassembled, clad in khaki middy suits, brown sailor hats, and hiking
      shoes, and the walk was begun along a path that led down a wooded hill
      behind the hotel and toward the nearest lake.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was not so much for exercise and fresh air that this "hike" was taken
      as for an opportunity to hold a conference where there was little
      likelihood of its being overheard. They picked a grassy knoll near the
      lake, shaded by a border of oak and butternut trees, and sat down close
      together in order that they might carry on a conversation in subdued
      tones.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now," said Miss Ladd, "we'll begin to form our plans. You all realize, I
      think, that we have an obstacle to work against that we did <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>not reckon on when we started. But
      that need not surprise us. In fact, as I think matters over, it would have
      been surprising if something of the kind had not occurred. This man
      Langford is undoubtedly here to block our plans. If that is true, in a
      sense it is an advantage to us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why?" Hazel Edwards inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't like the idea of answering questions of that kind without giving
      you girls an opportunity to answer them," the Guardian returned. "Now, who
      can tell me why it is an advantage to us to be followed by someone in the
      employ of the people whom we have been sent to investigate."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think I can answer it," Hazel said quickly, observing that two or three
      of the other girls seemed to have something to say. "Let me speak first,
      please. I asked the foolish question and want a chance to redeem myself."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I wouldn't call it foolish," was the Guardian's reassuring reply. "It was
      a very natural question and one that comparatively few people would be
      able to answer without considerable study. And yet, it is simple after you
      once get it. But go ahead and redeem yourself."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The fact that someone has been put on our trail to watch us is pretty
      good evidence that something wrong is going on," said Hazel. "You warned
      us not to be sure that anybody is guilty until we see the jam on his fist.
      But we can work more confidently if we are reasonably <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_45">45</span>certain that there is something to work for. If this
      man Langford is in the employ of the Grahams and is here watching us for
      them, we may be reasonably certain that Aunt Hannah was right in her
      suspicions about the way little Glen is being treated, may we not?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That is very good, Hazel," Miss Ladd commented enthusiastically. "Many
      persons a good deal older than you could not have stated the situation as
      clearly as you have stated it. Yes, I think I may say that I am almost
      glad that we are being watched by a spy.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But I didn't call you out here to have a long talk with you, girls. There
      really isn't much to say right now. First I wanted you all to understand
      clearly that we are being watched and for what purpose. Langford convicted
      himself when he asked for the double room next to the one occupied by
      Katherine and me and offered to pay the regular rate for two. He thinks
      that he is able to maintain an appearance of utter disinterest in us and
      throw us off our guard. But he overdoes the thing. He makes too big an
      effort to appear unconscious of our presence. It doesn't jibe at all with
      the expression of decided interest I have caught on his face on two or
      three occasions. And I flatter myself that I successfully concealed my
      interest in his interest in us.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, there are two things I want to say to you, and we will return.
      First, do your best, every one of you, to throw Langford off <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>the track by affecting the most
      innocent disinterest in him as of no more importance to us than the most
      obscure tourist on earth. Don't overdo it. Just make yourselves think that
      he is of no consequence and act accordingly without putting forth any
      effort to do so. The best way to effect this is to forget all about our
      mission when he is around.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Second, we must find out where the Graham cottage is and then determine
      where we want to locate our camp-somewhere in the vicinity of the Graham
      cottage, of course."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let me go out on a scouting expedition to find out where they live,"
      Katherine requested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And let me go with her," begged Ruth Hazelton.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "All right," Miss Ladd assented. "I'll commission you two to act as spies
      to approach the border of the enemy's country and make a map of their
      fortifications. But whatever you do, don't get caught. Keep your heads,
      don't do anything foolish or spasmodic, and keep this thing well in mind,
      that it is far better for you to come back empty handed than to make them
      suspicious of any ulterior motive on your part."

      "Now, girls," said Miss Ladd, addressing Katherine and Hazel, "let me hear
      what your plan is, if you have any. If you haven't any, we must get busy
      and work one out, for you must not start such an enterprise without having
      some idea as to how you should go about it. But I will assume that a
      suggestion must have come to you as to how best to get the first
      information we want or you would not have volunteered."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can't we work out an honor plan as we decide upon our duties and how we
      are to perform them?" Hazel inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Certainly," the Guardian replied, "I was going to suggest that very
      thing. What would you propose, Hazel?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, something like this," the latter replied: "that each of us be
      assigned to some specific duty to perform in the work before it, and that
      we be awarded honors for performing those duties intelligently and
      successfully."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Very well. I suppose this work you and Katherine have selected may count
      toward the winning of a bead for each of you. But what will you do after
      you have finished this task, which can hardly consume more than a few
      hours?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>"Why not make them a permanent
      squad of scouts to go out and gather advance information needed at any
      time before we can determine what to do?" Marion Stanlock suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's a good idea," Miss Ladd replied. "But it will have to come up at a
      business meeting of the Camp Fire in order that honors may be awarded
      regularly. Meanwhile I will appoint you two girls as scouts of the Fire,
      and this can be confirmed at the next business meeting. We will also
      stipulate the condition on which honors will be awarded. But how will you
      go about to get the information we now need."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "First, I would look in the general residence directory to find out where
      the Grahams live," Katherine replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, that is perhaps the best move to make first. But the chances are you
      will get nothing there. Can you tell me why?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Because there are probably few summer cottages within the city limits,"
      Hazel volunteered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Exactly," the Guardian agreed. "Well, if the city directory fails to give
      you any information, what would you do next?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Consult a telephone directory," Katherine said quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Fine!" Miss Ladd exclaimed. "What then?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They probably have a telephone; wouldn't be much society folks if they
      didn't," Katherine <span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>continued;
      "and there would, no doubt, be some sort of address for them in the 'phone
      book."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And that would give us some sort of guide for beginning our search. We
      wouldn't have to use the names of the people we are looking for."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That is excellent!" Miss Ladd exclaimed enthusiastically. "If you two
      scouts use your heads as cleverly as that all the time, you ought to get
      along fine in your work. But go on. What next would you do?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Go and find out where the people live. That needn't be hard. Then we'd
      look over the lay of the land to see if there were a good place near-by
      for us to pitch our tents."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes," put in Hazel; "and if we found a good place near-by, we'd begin the
      real work that we came here to do by going to the Graham house and asking
      who owns the land."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Fine again," Miss Ladd said. "I couldn't do better myself, maybe not as
      well. I did think of going with you on your first trip, but I guess I'll
      leave it all to you. Let's go back to the hotel now, and while you two
      scouts are gone scouting, the rest of us will find something to entertain
      us. Maybe we'll take a motorboat ride."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They started back at once and were soon at the hotel. Katherine and Hazel
      decided that they would not even look for the address of the Grahams in
      the directories at the hotel, <span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>but
      would go to a drug store on the main business street for this information.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other girls waited on the hotel portico while they were away on this
      mission. They were gone about twenty minutes and returned with a supply of
      picture post-cards to mail to their friends. On a piece of paper Katherine
      had written an address and she showed it to Miss Ladd. Here is what the
      latter read:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Stony Point."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's about three miles up the lake," Hazel said, "We thought we'd hire
      an automobile and go up there."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do," said Miss Ladd approvingly. "And we'll take a motorboat and ride up
      that way too, if we can get one. Oh, I have the idea now. We'll make it a
      double inspection, part by land and part from the lake. We'll meet you at
      a landing at Stony Point, if there is one, and will bring you back in the
      boat. Now, you, Katherine and Hazel, wait here while I go and find a
      motorboatman and make arrangements with him."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll go with you," said Violet Munday.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Guardian and Violet hastened down toward the main boat landing while
      the other twelve girls waited eagerly for a successful report on this part
      of the proposed program.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Miss Ladd and Violet returned in about twenty minutes and reported that
      satisfactory arrangements had been made for a trip up the lake. They were
      to start in an hour and a half.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then Katherine and Hazel engaged an automobile for a few hours' drive and
      before the motorboat started with its load of passengers, they were
      speeding along a hard macadam road toward the point around which centered
      the interest of their interrupted vacation plans at Fairberry and their
      sudden departure on a very unusual and very romantic journey.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Twin Lakes is a summer-resort town located on the lower of two bodies of
      water, similar in size, configuration, and scenery. The town has a more or
      less fixed population of about 2,500, most of whom are retired folk of
      means or earn their living directly or indirectly through the supplying of
      amusements, comfort, and sustenance for the thousands of pleasure and
      recreation seekers that visit the place every year.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Each of the lakes is about four miles long and half as wide. A narrow
      river, strait, or rapids nearly a mile long connects the two. Originally
      this rapids was impassable by boats larger than canoes, and even such
      little craft <span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>were likely to be
      overturned unless handled by strong and skillful canoemen; but some years
      earlier the state had cleared this passage by removing numerous great
      boulders and shelves of rock from the bed of the stream so that although
      the water rushed along just as swiftly as ever, the passage was
      nevertheless safe for all boats of whatever draught that moved on the two
      lakes which it connected.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The lower of the twin bodies of water had been named Twin-One because,
      perhaps, it was the first one seen, or more often seen by those who chose
      or approved the name; the other was Twin-Two. Geographically speaking, it
      may be, these names should have been applied vice versa, for Twin-Two was
      fed first by a deep and wide river whose source was in the mountains 200
      miles away, and Twin-One received these waters after they had laved the
      shores of Twin-Two.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The road followed by Katherine and Hazel in their automobile drive to
      Stony Point was a well-kept thoroughfare running from the south end of
      Twin-One, in gracefully curved windings along the east border of the lake,
      sometimes over a small stretch of rough or hilly shoreland, but usually
      through heavy growths of hemlock, white pine, oak, and other trees more or
      less characteristic of the country. Here and there along the way was a
      cottage, or summer house of more pretentious proportions, usually
      constructed near the water or some distance up on the side of <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>the hill-shore, with a kind of
      terrace-walk leading down to a boat landing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The trip was quickly made. Stony Point the girls found to be a picturesque
      spot not at all devoid of the verdant beauties of nature in spite of the
      fact that, geographically, it was well named. This name was due
      principally to a rock-formed promontory, jutting out into the lake at this
      point and seeming to be bedded deep into the lofty shore-elevation. Right
      here was a cluster of cottages, not at all huddled together, but none the
      less a cluster if viewed from a distance upon the lake, and in this group
      of summer residences appeared to be almost sufficient excuse for the
      drawing up of a petition for incorporation as a village. But very few of
      the owners of these houses lived in them during the winter months. The
      main and centrally located group consisted of a hotel and a dozen or more
      cottages, known as "The Hemlocks," and so advertised in the outing and
      vacation columns of newspapers of various cities.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On arriving at "the Point," Katherine and Hazel paid the chauffeur and
      informed him they would not need his machine any more that day. Then they
      began to look about them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were rather disappointed and decidedly puzzled at what they saw.
      Evidently they had a considerable search before them to discover the
      location of the Graham cottage without making open inquiry as to where it
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>stood. First they walked out
      upon the promontory, which had a flat table-like surface and was well
      suited for the arousing of the curiosity of tourists. There they had a
      good view up and down the bluff-jagged, hilly and tree-laden coast.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It's 11 o'clock now," said Hazel, looking at her wrist-watch. "The
      motorboat will be here at about 1 o'clock, and we have two hours in which
      to get the information we are after unless we want to share honors for
      success with the other girls when they arrive."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let's take a walk through this place and see what we can see," Katherine
      suggested. "The road we came along runs through it and undoubtedly there
      are numerous paths."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This seemed to be the best thing to do, and the two girls started from the
      Point toward the macadam highway. The latter was soon reached and they
      continued along this road northward from the place where they dismissed
      the automobile. Half a mile they traveled in this direction, their course
      keeping well along the lake shore. They passed several cottages of
      designedly rustic appearance and buried, as it were, amid a wealth of tree
      foliage and wild entanglements of shrubbery. Suddenly Katherine caught
      hold of Hazel's arm and held her back.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Did you hear that?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, I did," Hazel replied, "It sounded like a child's voice, crying."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>"And not very far away, either.
      Listen; there it is again."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was a half-smothered sob that reached their ears and seemed to come
      from a clump of bushes to the left of the road not more than a dozen yards
      away. Both girls started for the spot, circling around the bushes and
      peering carefully, cautiously ahead of them as they advanced. The subdued
      sobs continued and led the girls directly to the spot whence they came.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Presently they found themselves standing over the form of a little boy,
      his frightened, tear-stained face turned up toward them while he shrank
      back into the bushes as if fearing the approach of a fellow human being.
    </p>

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The little fellow retreated into the bushes as far as he could get and
      crouched there in manifest terror. Katherine and Hazel spoke gently,
      sympathetically to him, but with no result, at first, except to frighten
      him still more, if possible.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't be afraid, little boy," Hazel said, reaching out her hands toward
      him. "We won't hurt you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But he only shrank back farther, putting up his hands before his face and
      crying, "Don't, don't!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What can be the matter with him?" said Hazel. "He doesn't seem to be
      demented. He's really afraid of something."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine looked all around carefully through the trees and into the
      neighboring bushes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can't imagine what it can be," she replied. "There's nothing in sight
      that could do him any harm. But, do you know, Hazel, I have an idea that
      may be worth considering. Suppose this should prove to be the little boy
      for whom we are looking."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That could hardly be," Hazel answered dubiously. "Look at his threadbare
      clothes, and how unkempt and neglected he appears to be. He surely doesn't
      look like a boy for whose care $250 is paid every month."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>"Don't forget what it was that
      sent us here," Katherine reminded. "Isn't it just possible that this
      little boy's fright is proof of the very condition we came here to
      expose?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, it's possible," Hazel replied thoughtfully. "At least, we ought not
      neglect to find out what this means."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then turning again to the crouching figure in the bushes, she said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What is your name, little boy? Is it Glen?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At the utterance of this name, the youth shook as with ague.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Look out, Hazel; he'll have a spasm," Katherine cautioned. "He thinks we
      are not his friends and are going to do something he doesn't want us to
      do. Let me talk to him:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Listen, little boy," she continued, addressing the pitiful crouching
      figure. "We're not going to hurt you. We'll do just what you want us to
      do. We'll take you where you want to go. Will that be all right?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A relaxing of the tense attitude of the boy indicated that he was somewhat
      reassured by these words. His fists went suddenly to his eyes and he began
      to sob hysterically. Hazel moved toward him with more sympathetic
      reassurance, when there was an interruption of proceedings from a new
      source.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A girl about 18 years old stepped up in front of the two Camp Fire Girls
      and reached forward as if to seize the juvenile refugee with both hands.
      She was rather ultra-stylishly <span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>clad
      for a negligee, summer-resort community, wearing a pleated taffeta skirt
      and Georgette crepe waist and a white sailor hat of expensive straw with a
      bright blue ribbon around the crown. Hazel afterwards remarked that "her
      face was as cold as an iceberg and the odor of perfume about her was
      enough to asphyxiate a field of phlox and shooting-stars."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boy ceased sobbing as he beheld this new arrival and his face became
      white with fear, while he shrank back again into the bushes as far as he
      could get. The girl of much perfume and stylish attire seemed to be
      unmoved by the new panic that seized him, but took hold of him and dragged
      him roughly out of his hiding place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, do be careful," pleaded Hazel. "Don't you see he's scared nearly to
      death? You may throw him into a spasm."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is that any of your business?" the captor of the frightened youth
      snapped, looking defiantly at the one who addressed her. "He's my brother,
      and I guess I can take him back home without any interference from a
      perfect stranger. He's run away."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I beg your pardon," Hazel said gently; "but it didn't seem to me to be an
      ordinary case of fright. I didn't mean to intrude, but he's such a dear
      little boy I couldn't help being sympathetic."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He's a naughty bad runaway and ought to be whipped," the girl with the
      cold face returned <span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>as she
      started along a path through the timber, dragging the little fellow after
      her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Isn't that a shame!" Hazel muttered, digging her fingernails into the
      palms of her hands. "My, but I just like to--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She stopped for want of words to express her feelings not too riotously,
      and Katherine came to her relief by swinging the subject along a different
      track.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you really believe that boy is Glen Irving?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No, I suppose not," Hazel answered dejectedly. "You heard that girl say
      he was her brother, didn't you? Well, Glen has no sister. But, do you
      know, I really am disappointed to find that he isn't the boy we are
      looking for, for my heart went right out to him when I first saw his
      crouching form and white face. Moreover, I can hardly bear the thought of
      leaving him in the hands of that frosted bottle of cheap Cologne."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine laughed at the figure.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You've painted her picture right," she said warmly. "Come on, let's
      follow her. We have as much right to go that way as she has, and we must
      go someway anyway."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "All right; lead the way," Hazel said with smiling emphasis on the "way"
      to direct attention to Katherine's phonetic repetition.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter started along the path that had been taken by the girl and her
      frightened prisoner, and Hazel followed. The two in advance <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>were by this time out of sight beyond
      a thicket of bushes and small trees, but Katherine and Hazel did not
      hasten their steps, as they preferred to trust to the path to guide their
      steps rather than the view of the persons they sought to follow. In fact,
      they preferred to trust to the element of chance rather than run a risk of
      arousing the suspicion of the cold-faced girl with the perfume.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Only once did they catch sight of the boy and his captor in the course of
      their hesitating pursuit, and this view was so satisfactory that they
      stopped short in order to avoid possible detection if the girl should look
      back. A turn in the path brought them to the hip of the elevation where
      the ground began to slope down to the lake and near the downward bend of
      this beach-hill was a rustic cottage, with an equally rustic garage to the
      rear and on one side a cleared space for a tennis court. At the door of
      the cottage was the girl with the pleated skirt and white sailor hat,
      still leading the now submissive but quivering youth.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Fine!" Katherine exclaimed under her breath. "Things have turned out just
      right. If that should prove to be the Graham home we couldn't wish for
      better luck. Come on; let's back through the timber and approach this
      place from another direction. They mustn't suspect that we followed that
      girl and the little boy."

        CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class="c002">THE MAN IN THE AUTO.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Cautiously Katherine and Hazel withdrew from the path into a thicket and
      thence retreated along the path by which they had approached the house.
      They continued their retreat to the point where the path joined the
      automobile road and where grew the thicket within which they had
      discovered the frightened runaway child.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, I tell you what we ought to do," Katherine said. "We ought to follow
      this road about a mile, maybe, to get a view of lay of the land and then
      return to this spot, or near it. We can get the information we want after
      we learn more of the camping possibilities of this neighborhood and can
      talk intelligently when we begin to make inquiries."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And when we get back," Hazel added, "we'll go to some neighboring house
      and ask all about who lives here and who lives there, and, of course,
      we'll be particular to ask the name of the family where that icy bottle of
      perfume lives."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's the very idea," Katherine agreed enthusiastically. "But we haven't
      any time to waste, for it is nearly 12 o'clock now, and we have only a
      little more than an hour to work in if the motorboat arrives on time.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>We'd better not try to walk a
      mile-half a mile will be enough, maybe a quarter-just enough to enable us
      to talk intelligently about the lay of the land right around here."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They walked north along the road nearly half a mile, found a path which
      led directly toward the lake, followed it until within view of the water's
      edge, satisfied themselves that there were several excellent camping
      places along the shore in this vicinity and then started back. They had
      passed three or four cottages on their way and at one of these they
      stopped to make inquiries as planned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A pleasant-faced woman in comfortable domestic attire met them at the door
      and answered their questions with a readiness that bespoke familiarity
      with the neighborhood and acquaintance with her neighbors. Katherine and
      Hazel experienced no slight difficulty in concealing their eager
      satisfaction when Mrs. Scott, the woman they were questioning, said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The people who have the cottage just north of us are the Pruitts of
      Wilmington, those just south of us are the Ertsmans of Richmond, and those
      just south of the Ertsmans are the Grahams of Baltimore, I think. I am not
      very well acquainted with that family. I am sure we would be delighted to
      have a group of Camp Fire Girls near us and you ought to have no
      difficulty in getting permission to pitch your tents. This land along here
      belongs to an estate which is managed by a man <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_63">63</span>living in Philadelphia. He is represented here by a
      real estate man, Mr. Ferris, of Twin Lakes. He probably will permit you to
      camp here for little or nothing."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girls thanked the woman warmly for this information and then hurried
      away.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We don't need to call at the Graham cottage now," Hazel said as they
      hastened back to the road. "We have all the preliminary information that
      we want. The next thing for us to do is to get back to the Point and meet
      the boat when it comes in and have a talk with the other girls. I suppose
      our first move then ought to be to go to Twin Lakes and get permission
      from that real estate man, Ferris, to pitch our tents on the land he has
      charge of."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The two girls kept up their rapid walk until within a few hundred feet of
      the drive that led from the main road to the cottage occupied by the
      Grahams. Then they slowed up a little as they saw an automobile
      approaching ahead of them. The machine also slowed up somewhat as it
      neared the drive. Suddenly Hazel exclaimed, half under her breath:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It's going to stop. I wonder what for?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, and there's something familiar in that man's appearance," Katherine
      said slowly. "Why--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She did not finish the sentence, for the automobile was so near she was
      afraid the driver would hear her. But there was no need for her to say
      what she had in her mind to say. <span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>Hazel
      recognized the man as soon as she did.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Be careful," Katherine warned. "Don't let him see that we know him. Just
      pass him as you would a perfect stranger."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But they did not pass the automobile as expected. Although slowing up, the
      machine did not stop, and for the first time the girls realised the
      probable nature of the man's visit to Stony Point.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "O Hazel!" Katherine whispered; "he's turning in at the Graham place."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I bet he's come here to warn them against us," Hazel returned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It must be something of the kind," Katherine agreed, and then the near
      approach to the automobile rendered unwise any further conversation on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girls were within 100 feet of the machine as it turned in on the
      Graham drive and found that they had all they could do to preserve a calm
      and unperturbed demeanor as they met the keen searching gaze of the squint
      eyes of Pierce Langford, the lawyer from Fairberry.

        CHAPTER XIII. <br /> <br /><span class="c002">A NONSENSE PLOT.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Katherine and Hazel walked past the drive, into which Attorney Langford's
      automobile had turned, apparently without any concern or interest in the
      occupant of the machine. But after they had advanced forty or fifty yards
      beyond the drive, Hazel's curiosity got the best of her and she turned her
      head and looked back. The impulse to do this was so strong, she said
      afterward, that it seemed impossible for her to control the action. Her
      glance met the gaze of the squint eyes of the man in the auto.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My! that was a foolish thing for me to do," she said as she quickly faced
      ahead again. "I suppose that look has done more damage than anything else
      since we started from Fairberry. And to think that I above all others
      should have been the one to do it. I'm ashamed of myself."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Did he see you?" Katherine inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He was looking right at me," Hazel replied; "and that look was full of
      suspicion and meaning. There's no doubt he's on our trail and suspects
      something of the nature of our mission."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh don't let that bother you," Katherine advised. "There's no reason why
      he should jump to a conclusion just because you looked back at him. That
      needn't necessarily mean <span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>anything.
      But if you let it make you uneasy, you may give us dead away the next time
      you meet him."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I believe he knows what our mission here is already," was Katherine's
      fatalistic answer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "If that's the case, you needn't worry any more about what you do or say
      in his presence," said Hazel. "We might as well go to him and tell him our
      story and have it all over with."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't agree with you," Katherine replied. "I believe that the worst
      chance we have to work against is the probability of suspicion on his
      part. I don't see how he can know anything positively. He probably merely
      learned of our intended departure for Twin Lakes and, knowing that the
      Grahams were spending the summer here, began to put two and two together.
      I figure that he followed us on his own responsibility."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And that his visit at the Graham cottage today is to give them warning of
      our coming," Hazel added.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, very likely," Katherine agreed. "I'd like to hear the conversation
      that is about to take place in that house. I bet it would be very
      interesting to us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No doubt of it," said the other; "and it might prove helpful to us in our
      search for the information we were sent to get."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't you think it strange, Hazel, that your aunt should select a bunch
      of girls like us to do so important a piece of work as this?" <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>Katherine inquired. This question had
      puzzled her a good deal from the moment the proposition had been put to
      her. Although she had received it originally from Mrs. Hutchins even
      before the matter had been broached to Hazel, she had not questioned the
      wisdom of the move, but had accepted the role of advocate assigned to her
      as if the proceeding were very ordinary and commonsensible.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "If you hadn't restricted your remark to 'a bunch of girls like us', I
      would answer 'yes'," Hazel replied; "I'd say that it was very strange for
      Aunt Hannah to select a 'bunch of girls' to do so important a piece of
      work as this. But when you speak of the 'bunch' as a 'bunch of girls like
      us,' I reply 'No, it wasn't strange at all'."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm afraid you're getting conceited, Hazel," Katherine protested gently.
      "I know you did some remarkable work when you found your aunt's missing
      papers, but you shouldn't pat yourself on the back with such a resounding
      slap."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I wasn't referring to myself particularly," Hazel replied with a smile
      suggestive of "something more coming." "I was referring principally to my
      very estimable Camp Fire chums, and of course it would look foolish for me
      to attempt to leave myself out of the compliment. I suppose I shall have
      to admit that I am a very classy girl, because if I weren't, I couldn't be
      associated with such a classy bunch-see? Either I have to be classy or
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>accuse you other girls of being
      common like myself."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm quite content to be called common," said Katherine.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But I don't think you are common, and that's where the difficulty comes
      in."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Won't you be generous and call me classy, and I'll admit I'm classy to
      keep company with my classy associates, and you can do likewise and we can
      all be an uncommonly classy bunch of common folks."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "If we could be talking a string of nonsense like this every time we meet
      Mr. Langford, we could throw him off the track as easy as scat," said
      Hazel meditatively. "What do you say, Katherine?-let's try it the next
      time he's around: We'll be regular imp-, inp-What's the word-impromptu
      actors."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We mustn't overdo it," Katherine cautioned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Of course not. Why should we? We'll do just as we did this time-let one
      idea lead on to another in easy, rapid succession. Think it over and
      whenever you get an idea pass it around, and we'll be all primed for him.
      It'll be lots of fun if we get him guessing, and be to our advantage,
      too."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hazel and Katherine reached the Point in time to see the motorboat
      containing the other members of the Fire approaching about a mile away.
      They did not know, of course, who were in the boat, and as it was deemed
      wise not to indulge in any demonstrations, no <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_69">69</span>one on either side did any signalling; but they were
      not long in doubt as to who the passengers were. A flight of steps led
      from the top of the point to the landing, and the two advance spies, as
      they were now quite content to be called, walked down these and were
      waiting at the water's edge when the boat ran along the pile-supported
      platform.

        CHAPTER XIV. <br /> <br /><span class="c002"> SPARRING FOR A FEE.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Pierce Langford drove the automobile, in which he made his first trip to
      Stony Point, up to the end of his drive near the Graham cottage, and
      advanced to the front entrance. The porch on which he stood awaiting the
      appearance of someone to answer his knock-there was no bell at the
      door-was bordered with a railing of rough-hewn, but uniformly selected,
      limbs of hard wood or saplings. The main structure of the house was of
      yellow pine, but the outer trimmings were mainly of such rustic material
      as the railing of the porch.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The front door was open, giving the visitor a fairly good view of the
      interior. The front room was large and fairly well furnished with light
      inexpensive furniture, grass rugs and an assortment of nondescript,
      "catch-as-catch-can," but not unattractive, art upon the walls. Langford,
      who was not a sleepy schemer, was able to get a good view of the room
      before any one appeared to answer his knock.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was a woman who appeared, a sharp featured, well-dressed matron with a
      challenging eye. Perhaps no stranger, or person out of the exclusive
      circle that she assumed to represent, ever approached her without being
      met <span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>with the ocular demand.
      "Who are you?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Pierce Langford recognized this demand at once. If he had been of less
      indolent character this unscrupulous attorney might have made a brilliant
      success as a criminal lawyer in a metropolis. The fact that he was content
      with the limitations of a practice in a city of 3,500 inhabitants,
      Fairberry, his home town, was of itself indicative of his indolence. And
      yet, when he took a case, he manifested gifts of shrewdness that would
      have made many another lawyer of much greater practice jealous.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Attorney Langford's shrewdness and indolence were alternately
      intermittent. When the nerve centers of his shrewdness were stimulated his
      indolence lapsed and he was very much on the alert. The present was one of
      those instances. He knew something, by reputation, of the woman who
      confronted him. He had had indirect dealing with her before, but he had
      never met her. However, he was certain that she would recognize his name.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is this Mrs. Graham?" he inquired, although he scarcely needed to ask the
      question.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is," she replied with evidently habitual precision.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My name is Langford-Pierce Langford," he announced, and then waited for
      the effect of this limited information.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The woman started. It was a startled start. The challenge of her
      countenance wavered; <span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>the
      precision of her manner became an attitude of caution.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not-not Pierce Langford of-of-?" she began.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The man smiled on one side of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The very one, none other," he answered cunningly. "Not to be in the least
      obscure, I am from the pretty, quiet and somewhat sequestered city of
      Fairberry. You know the place, I believe."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I've never been there and hope I shall never have occasion to go to your
      diminutive metropolis," she returned rather savagely.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No?" the visitor commented with a rising inflection for rhetorical
      effect. "By the way, may I come in?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Certainly," Mrs. Graham answered recovering quickly from a partial lapse
      of mindfulness of the situation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The woman turned and led the way into the house and the visitor followed.
      Mrs. Graham directed the lawyer to a reed rocking chair and herself sat
      down on another reed-rest of the armchair variety. The woman by this time
      had recovered something of her former challenging attitude and inquired:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, Mr. Langford, what is the meaning of this visit?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Very much meaning, Mrs. Graham," was the reply; "and of very much
      significance to you, I suspect. I come here well primed with information
      which I am sure will cause you to <span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>welcome
      me as you perhaps would welcome nobody else in the world."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Graham leaned forward eagerly, expectantly, apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You come as a friend, I assume," she said.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Have you any reason to doubt it?" the man inquired. "If it were
      otherwise, I must necessarily come as a traitor. I hope you will not
      entertain any such opinion of me as that. As long as you treat me fairly,
      you'll find me absolutely on the square for you and your interests."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I hope so," returned the woman in a tone of voice that could hardly be
      said to convey any significance other than the dictionary meaning of the
      words. "But let's get down to business. What is this information that you
      come here primed with? Has it to do with the old subject?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Certainly, very intimately, and with nothing else."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "In what way?" Mrs. Graham asked with more eagerness than she intended to
      disclose.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, there are some spies in this neck of the woods."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Spies!" the woman exclaimed, betraying still more of the eagerness she
      was still struggling against.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes spies. That's exactly what they call themselves."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Who are they?-how do you know they are here to spy on me?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I overheard their plans. I got wind in a <span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>roundabout
      way, as a result of talk on the part of Mrs. Hutchins' servants, that
      there was something doing, with Twin Lakes as a central point of interest.
      I suspected at once that your interests were involved; so I stole slyly,
      Willie Hawkshaw-like, up to their rendezvous one night and listened to
      some of them as they discussed their plans and-"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Some of them," Mrs. Graham interrupted, "How many are there?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, a whole troup of them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's a funny story," the woman commented dubiously, searching the face
      of her visitor for an explanation of his, to her, queer statements.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not at all so funny when you hear it in detail," Langford returned
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well hurry up with the details," the impatient Mrs. Graham demanded.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There's no need of being in a hurry," the lawyer said with provoking
      calmness. "Business is business, you see, and full confidences should
      never be exchanged in a situation of this kind until a contract is drawn
      up, signed, sealed, witnessed, and recorded. In other words, I ought to
      have an understanding and a retainer before I go any farther."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Graham had no reason to doubt that this was coming sooner or later,
      but she winced nevertheless when it came.

      "I hope you realize, Mr. Langford, that we are not exactly made of money,"
      Mrs. Graham remarked tentatively by way of meeting the demand which she
      read between his words. "Moreover, we were under heavy expenses during the
      last year and you got a good deal of what we paid out."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not so very much," Langford corrected, from his point of view. "You must
      remember that I was working for you through another man and he handled the
      pay roll, on which he and I were the only payees, and naturally he took
      what he didn't absolutely have to give to me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, how much do you want for this service?" the woman inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I ought to have at least $25 a day and my expenses," the lawyer answered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Absolutely out of the question. That's several times the amount of our
      income from the source you are interested in. And a considerable part of
      that has to go for the boy's clothing, board and education."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That is one of the important points to which I am coming," Langford
      interrupted. "I come to inform you that Mrs. Hutchins is very much
      interested in how the boy is being clothed and fed and educated, and also
      how he <span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>is being treated, and
      she has decided to find those things out."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It's a case of her old suspicions being revived?" Mrs. Graham asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I suppose so; anyway, she's mighty suspicious."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Who's been peddling stories to her?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's something I didn't find out."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't you think a $25-a-day man ought to find out?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Perhaps; and perhaps I could have discovered that very thing if I had
      thought it wise to spend the time on it. After the mischief was done, it
      seemed hardly worth while to expend any effort to find the mischief maker.
      I decided it was best to get after the mischief itself and stop it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I suppose you're right," assented Mrs. Graham. "But it really would be a
      lot of satisfaction to know who the traitor is."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "This is no time to waste any of your efforts on revenge. That may come
      later, not now. But how about my fee?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You ask too much."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't agree with you, That is a very small fee, compared with what some
      attorneys get. Why, I know lawyers who never take a case under $100 a
      day."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's in the big cities, where they are under heavy expenses-costly
      offices and office help."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Where do you get your information?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, I have traveled and lived," the woman <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_77">77</span>replied with emphasis on the last word. "And I know
      there are plenty of judges who get only $10 a day, some less. Now, what do
      you think of that? Do you think you ought to get more than a judge?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, fudge on the judges," Langford exclaimed in affected disgust. "No big
      lawyer will take one of those political jobs. There are lots of big
      lawyers making $50,000 or $100,000 a year, and there are few judges
      getting more than $10,000."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, I can't pay more than $10 a day, and I can't pay that very long.
      We're under heavy expenses here and in Baltimore."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You ought to economize, Mrs. Graham," Langford advised. "Remember, this
      special income can't last forever. The boy is past 10 years old now, and
      if nobody takes it away from you earlier, it will stop when he is 21."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Take it away!" Mrs. Graham exclaimed in a startled manner, indicating
      that her apprehension had not carried her imagination as far as this.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Sure-why not?" the lawyer returned. "What do you think all this talk
      about spies has been leading up to?-a Christmas present? If Mrs. Hutchins
      is suspicious enough to send a lot of spies here to get the goods on you,
      don't you think she has some notion of taking some sort of drastic
      action?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What kind of 'goods' does she expect to get on me?" the woman inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can't you guess?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>"I can't imagine, dream, or
      suspect."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Just hurry things along to an agreement tween you and me, and I'll tell
      you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll give you $10 a day and reasonable expenses. That doesn't include
      your board; only your carfare and such incidentals when you're away from
      home. That is all conditioned, of course, on your proving to my
      satisfaction that you have the information you say you have. There's no
      use of my fighting for this income if I have to pay it all out without
      getting my benefit from it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll try not to be so hard on you as all that," Langford reassured the
      woman. "I accept your offer, although it's the minimum I would consider. I
      suppose you are prepared to give me a check today?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, I can give you something-your expenses thus far and maybe a little
      besides. Now hurry up and tell your story."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can do it in a few words. Mrs. Hutchins has sent a dozen or more girls
      up here to find out how you treat the youngster and if he is well fed,
      clothed and educated. She's received word from some source to the contrary
      and is planning to take him away if she discovers that her suspicions are
      true. These spies are all Camp Fire Girls who were camping on her farm.
      One of them is her niece. The proof of my statement that they are here to
      spy on you is in their plan to camp near your cottage and cultivate an
      intimate acquaintance with your family, particularly your two daughters.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>Two of them were up here
      looking over the lay of the ground; maybe they're here yet. Undoubtedly
      you'll see something of them tomorrow or the next day."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Graham's eyes flashed dangerously. Langford saw the menace in her
      look and manner.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "As I am now in your employ as counsel," he said, "I'll begin giving
      advice at once. Cut out this hate business. It's your worst enemy. Just be
      all smiles and dimples and give them the sweetest con game welcome
      imaginable. Pretend to be delighted to meet the bunch of Camp Fire Girls.
      Tell them you had long held their organization in the highest esteem. Take
      your two daughters into your fullest confidence. Tell them they must play
      their part, too, and play it well. They must be eager to become Camp Fire
      Girls and seek to be chummy with the spies.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And as for the boy, in whom they are specially interested, you must treat
      him as if you regard him the dearest little darling on earth." (Mrs.
      Graham's face soured at this suggestion,) "No, none of that, or you'll
      spoil the whole game. Mrs. Hutchins means business, and all she needs to
      do is to prove a few acts of cruelty and neglect, and any court in the
      land will give her speedy custody of the child, in view of the provisions
      of his father's will, which, you know, are very exacting of you and very
      friendly toward Mrs. Hutchins and her late husband. By the way, where are
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>the child and the other members
      of your family?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My husband is in Baltimore working at his regular employment," Mrs.
      Graham answered. "I expect him here next week; his vacation begins then.
      My son, James, Jr., went up the lakes this morning with some friends of
      his. Addie, my oldest daughter, went to Twin Lakes to do some shopping,
      and the other girl, Olga, is in the next room with Glen."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "By the way, Mrs. Graham, how well is the boy supplied with clothing?"
      Langford inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He has some good suits," Mrs. Graham replied slowly as if going over
      Glen's wardrobe piece by piece, in her mind.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Dress him up in his best and get some more for special occasions. You
      might be working on some article of clothing for him also. That would
      indicate strongly that you are interested in his welfare.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, if you don't mind, I will take my check and go. I'll be back again,
      but don't think it advisable to come often. I have prepared a short
      telephone cipher code by which we can carry on a commonplace conversation
      over the wire and let each other know if all is well or if trouble is
      brewing or has already broken. Here is a copy of it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Graham wrote the lawyer a check for $35, and he arose to depart.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Remember," he said as he stood facing the woman schemer at the doorway;
      "the success <span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>of this little
      plan of ours rests in the ability of yourself and other members of the
      family to play the most spontaneously genteel game the cleverest persons
      ever planned. If you fall down on this, undoubtedly you'll lose your
      handsome side-issue income of $3,500 a year."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then he went out, cranked his rented automobile, and drove away.

    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The twelve girls in the boat landed and proceeded with Katherine and Hazel
      up the steps to the top of the Point, where a conference was held. The two
      advance scouts reported developments in detail, much to the interest and
      delight of the other girls. The progress made thus far was so encouraging
      that everybody showed a disposition of impatience at the first sign of
      inactivity.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We must go right back and get permission from Mr. Ferris to locate our
      camp somewhere near the Graham home," said Katherine. "We ought to get our
      tents pitched just as soon as possible, and we mustn't run any risk of not
      being able to find Mr. Ferris today."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't you think it would help to allay their suspicions if we all
      remained here a while and looked around as if interested in the scenery
      just as tourists?" Azalia Atwood suggested
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No, I don't," Katherine replied quickly. "Either that man Langford
      suspects us or he doesn't. If he suspects us, he has grounds for his
      suspicion, and any such attempt to throw him off the track would result in
      failure. I think we had better assume that he knows what we are up to and
      act accordingly, without appearing to admit it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But won't they try to cover up the evidence that we are after?" Julietta
      Hyde reasoned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>"Of course they will,"
      Katherine answered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That will be one of the most interesting features of this adventure,"
      said Helen Nash, who already had a reputation wider than the Camp Fire
      circle for natural shrewdness. "When they begin to do that, we'll have
      some great fun."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can't you point out from the lake the place or places where you think it
      would be well for us to locate our camp?" Miss Ladd inquired, addressing
      Hazel and Katherine.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You can get a pretty good view of it right from here," Hazel replied.
      "It's right up the shore between those two cottages which are about the
      same distance up from the water and have similar paths and flights of
      steps running down to their boat landings. Between those two places is a
      stretch of timber-land that doesn't seem to be used by anybody in
      particular. We didn't explore it because we didn't have time, but it
      surely must contain some good camping places. We saw several small open
      spots near the road that could be used if nothing better is found. We must
      make a thorough inspection, of course, before we select a site, but that
      won't take long and can be done when we bring our outfit up here."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We ought to take a run in the boat along the shore and see if we can't
      find a good landing place," Katherine suggested. "Wouldn't it be
      delightful if we could find a suitable place on the side of that hill and
      overlooking the lake? Let's take enough time for that."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>"It's a good idea," said Miss
      Ladd warmly. "Let's do that at once and then run back to Twin Lakes. But
      remember, girls, don't say anything about our mission on the boat. The
      boatman would be sure to start some gossip that probably would reach the
      ears of the very persons we want to keep in the dark as much as possible."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were soon back in the large canopied motorboat, and Miss Ladd gave
      instructions to the pilot. The latter cranked his engine, took his place
      at the wheel, and backed the vessel away from the landing. A few moments
      later the "Big Twin," as the owner facetiously named the boat to
      distinguish it from a smaller one which he called the "Little Twin," was
      dashing along the wooded hill-shore which extended nearly a mile to the
      north from Stony Point. They obtained a good view of the section of the
      shore just north of the Graham cottage and picked out several spots which
      appeared from the distance viewed to be very good camping sites. Then the
      prow of the boat was turned to the south and they cut along at full speed
      toward Twin Lakes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The run was quickly made, and Katherine and Hazel hastened at once to the
      Ferris real estate office and presented their petition to Mr. Ferris in
      person. The latter was much interested when he learned that a Fire of Camp
      Fire Girls desired permission to pitch their tents on land of which he was
      the local <span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>agent, and still more
      interested when informed that they were students at Hiawatha Institute
      whose reputation was well known to him. He gave them a pen-and-ink drawing
      of the vicinity, indicating the approximate lines of the lands owned or
      leased by cottagers then in possession, and granted them permission, free
      of charge, to locate their camp at any place they desired so long as they
      did not encroach on the rights of others.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      An hour later the squint-eyed man whose activities have already created
      much of interest in this narrative entered the office of Mr. Ferris and
      inquired:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Are you agent for that land along the lake just north of Stony Point?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I am," the real estate man replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you allow campers to pitch their tents on the land for a week or two
      at a time?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't object if they are all right. I always require some sort of
      credentials. I wouldn't allow strangers to squat there without giving me
      some kind of notice. I granted permission to a bunch of Camp Fire Girls
      today to pitch their tents there."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is that so? Where are they going to locate?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Just beyond the Graham cottage, if you know where that is."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That is where some friends of mine would like to camp," said Langford in
      an affected tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't think I'd care to grant any more <span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>permits
      in that vicinity," Mr. Ferris announced rather meditatively. "I feel
      rather a personal interest in the girls and don't want any strangers to
      pitch a camp too near them. Your friends might, perhaps, locate half a
      mile farther up the shore."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll tell them what you say," Langford said as he left the office.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Five minutes later he was in a telephone booth calling for No. 123-M. A
      woman answered the ring.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is this Mrs. Graham?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "This is Langford. I just called to inform you that the parties we were
      talking about have obtained permission to camp near your cottage. You'll
      probably see something of them tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And I'll be at your place tomorrow afternoon between 3 and 4 o'clock."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll expect you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That ended the conversation.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      That evening Miss Ladd received the letter that Mrs. Hutchins had
      announced in her telegram addressed to the Guardian on the train, would
      follow that communication. She did not discuss the matter with any of the
      girls, but quietly passed it around until all had read it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In her letter Mrs. Hutchins stated little that had not been read between
      the lines of the telegram, although her views and comments on the
      circumstances were interesting. She had seen Pierce Langford arrive at the
      station just as the train was pulling in, buy a ticket and board the train
      just as it was pulling out. Curiosity, stirred perhaps by the recollection
      that this man had recently represented interests hostile to the mission of
      the Thirteen Camp Fire Girls and their Guardian, and might still represent
      those interests, caused her to inquire of the agent for what point Mr.
      Langford had purchased his ticket. The reply was "Twin Lakes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That was sufficient. The woman asked for a telegram pad and wrote a few
      lines. Then she gave the message to the operator with these directions:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I want that to catch Miss Ladd in the limited as soon as possible. Keep
      it going from <span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span>station to
      station until it is delivered. Have the operator who succeeds in getting
      the message into Miss Ladd's hands wire back 'delivered' as soon as she
      receives it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On the day following the advance excursion and inspection of the camping
      prospects at Stony Point, the "Big Twin" was engaged again to convey the
      Camp Fire Girls to the prospective camping place. On this occasion the
      tents and other paraphernalia were taken aboard and conveyed to the scene
      of the proposed camp. The boat skirted along the shore and a careful
      examination was made to discover landing places that might provide access
      from the lake to such camping sites as might later be found.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Several good landing places were found. The one they selected tentatively
      as a mooring for the boat was a large flat-rock projection a few hundred
      yards north of the Graham pier. A comparatively level shore margin
      extended back nearly a hundred feet from this rock to the point, where the
      wooded incline began. The boatman and a boy of eighteen who had been
      engaged to assist in handling the heavier paraphernalia, remained in the
      boat while the girls started off in pairs to explore the near-by territory
      for the most advantageous and available site.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They came together again half an hour later and compared notes. The result
      was that the report made by Marion Stanlock and Harriet Newcomb proved the
      most interesting. They <span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>had
      found a pretty nook half way up the side of the hill shore and sheltered
      by a bluff on the inland side and trees and bushes at either end, so that
      no storm short of a hurricane could seriously damage a well-constructed
      camp in this place. The area was considerable, quite sufficient for the
      pitching of the complement of tents of the Fire.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After all the girls had inspected this proposed site in a body, a
      unanimous vote was taken in favor of its adoption. This being their
      decision, they returned without delay to the boat and the work of carrying
      their camping outfit a distance of some three hundred yards was begun.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The pilot and the boy assistant took the heavier luggage while the girls
      carried the lighter articles and supplies. In this manner everything was
      transported to the camp site in about an hour. The pilot and the boy then
      assisted in the work of putting up the tents, and after this was finished
      they were paid and dismissed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Everything went along smoothly while all this was being done. Not another
      person appeared in sight during this period, except the occupants of
      several boats that motored by. The Graham cottage was about a quarter of a
      mile to the south and farther up on the hill, but the screen of dense
      foliage shut it off from view at the girls' camp.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All the rest of the day was required to put the camp into good
      housekeeper's condition. <span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>The
      light folding cots had to be set up and got ready for sleeping, the
      kitchen tent also required much domestic art and ingenuity for the most
      convenient and practical arrangement, and a fireplace for cooking had to
      be built with rocks brought up principally from the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      So eager were they to finish all this work that they did not stop to
      prepare much of a luncheon. They ate hurriedly-prepared sandwiches,
      olives, pickles, salmon, and cake, and drank lemonade, picnic style, and
      kept at their camp preparation "between bites," as it were. In the
      evening, however, they had a good Camp Fire Girls' supper prepared by
      Hazel Edwards, Julietta Hyde and the Guardian. Then they sat around their
      fire and chatted, principally about the beauty of the scenery on every
      hand.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But they were tired girls and needed no urging to seek rest on their cots
      as the sun sunk behind the hills on the opposite side of the lake. The
      move "bedward" was almost simultaneous and the drift toward slumberland
      not far behind. They had one complete day undisturbed with anything of a
      mysterious or startling nature, and it was quite a relief to find it
      possible to seek a night's repose after eight or nine hours of diligent
      work without being confronted with apprehensions of some impending danger
      or possible defeat of their plans.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Next morning the girls all awoke bright and early, thoroughly refreshed by
      their night's rest. A breakfast of bacon, flapjacks and maple syrup, bread
      and butter and chocolate invigorated them for a new day of camp life in a
      new place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Their program was already pretty well mapped out, being practically the
      same as that followed while in camp in Fern Hollow near Fairberry. They
      still did some work on certain lines arranged under the honor lists of the
      craft, but were giving particular attention to knitting and sewing for the
      Red Cross, which they aided in an auxiliary capacity.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The program regularly followed by the girls required three hours of
      routine work each day. This they usually performed between the hours of 7
      and 10 or 8 and 11, depending upon the time of their getting up and the
      speed with which they disposed of the early morning incidentals.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On this morning, in spite of the fact that they had gone to bed thoroughly
      tired as a result of the exertions of the preceding day, the girls arose
      shortly after 6 o'clock and by 7:30 all were engaged in various
      record-making occupations, including the washing of the breakfast dishes
      and the making of the beds and the general tidying-up of the camp.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>After the routine had been
      attended to, the girls took a hike for the purpose of exploring the
      country to the north of their camp. This exploration extended about two
      miles along the shore, their route being generally the automobile road
      that skirted the lake at varying distances of from a few rods to a quarter
      of a mile from the water's edge, depending upon the configuration of the
      shore line.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      During much of this hike, Katherine, Hazel and Miss Ladd walked together
      and discussed plans for creating a condition of affairs that might be
      expected to produce results in harmony with the purpose of their mission.
      They were all at sea at first, but after a short and fruitless discussion
      of what appeared to be next to nothing, Katherine made a random suggestion
      which quickly threw a more hopeful light on affairs.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It seems to me that we've got to do something that will attract
      attention," she said. "We'll have to do some sensational, or at least
      lively, stunts so that everybody will know we are here and will want to
      know who we are."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's the very idea." Miss Ladd said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine was a little startled at this reception of her suggestion. When
      she spoke, she was merely groping for an idea. But Miss Ladd's approval
      woke her up to a realization that she had unwittingly hit the nail on the
      head.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes," she said, picking up the thread of a <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_93">93</span>real idea as she proceeded; "we have got to attract
      attention. That's the only way we can get the people in whom we are most
      interested to show an interest in us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What shall we do?" Hazel inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Map out a spectacular program of some sort," Katherine replied. "We might
      build a big bonfire, for one thing, on the shore tonight and go through
      some of our gym exercises, including folk dances."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Good," said Hazel. "Let's start off with that. And tomorrow we can have
      some games that will make it necessary for us to ran all over the
      country-hare and hounds, for instance."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We ought to find a good safe swimming place near our camp, too,"
      Katherine said.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let's look for one this afternoon," Miss Ladd suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How will we test it?" Hazel inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's easy," the Guardian replied. "We'll use poles to try the depth and
      then one of us will swim out with one end of a rope attached to her and
      the other end in the hands of two of the girls ready to haul in if she
      needs assistance. In that way we will be able to locate a good swimming
      place and not run any risk of anybody's being drowned."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We've got a good starter, anyway," Katherine remarked in a tone of
      satisfaction. "By the time we've taken care of those items something more
      of the same character ought to occur to us. Yes, that's the very way to
      interest <span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>the Grahams in our
      presence and open the way for an acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The three now separated and mingled with the other girls who were some
      distance ahead or behind, and communicated the new plan to all of them. It
      was received with general approval and was the main topic of conversation
      until they all returned to the camp for luncheon.
    </p>
    <div class="pbb">

      <h2 id="ch1-19" class="c007">
        CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class="c002">WATCHED.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      After luncheon, the girls, with two sharp hatchets among them, began a
      search through the timber for some long, slim saplings. After a half
      hour's search they were in possession of three straight cottonwood poles,
      ten or twelve feet long, and with these in their possession, they began an
      examination of the water-depth along the shore for a safe and suitable
      bathing place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They might have used their fishing rods for this purpose, but these were
      not serviceable, as they were of extremely light material and, moreover,
      were hardly long enough for this purpose. The saplings proved to be
      excellent "feelers" and the work progressed rapidly from the start.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      About 200 yards north of their camp was a sandy beach which extended along
      the shore a considerable distance. It was here that the girls made their
      first under-water exploration, They tied a rough stone near one end of
      each of the poles to increase its specific gravity and then proceeded to
      "feel" for depth along the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Careful examination with these poles failed to disclose a sudden drop from
      the gradual downward slope of the beach into the water, so that there
      appeared to be no treacherous <span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>places
      near the shore. Satisfied in this respect, they now arranged for a further
      test. Azalia Atwood, who was an excellent swimmer, returned to the camp,
      donned a bathing suit, and then rejoined the other girls, bringing with
      her a long rope of the clothesline variety. One end of this was looped
      around her waist, and Marion Stanlock had an opportunity to exhibit her
      skill at tying a bowline.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      While two of the girls held the rope and payed it out, Azalia advanced
      into the water, stepping ahead carefully in order to avoid a surprise of
      any sort resulting from some hidden danger under the surface of the lake.
      To some, all this caution might seem foolish, inasmuch as Azalia swam
      well, but one rule of Flamingo Camp Fire prohibited even the best swimmers
      from venturing into water more than arm-pit deep unless they were at a
      beach provided with expert life-saving facilities.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The purpose of Azalia's exploration was to wade over as large an area of
      lake bottom as possible and establish a certainty that it was free from
      deep step-offs, "bottomless" pockets and treacherous undertow. Soon it
      became evident that she had a bigger undertaking before her than she had
      reckoned on, for the bed of the lake sloped very gradually at this point,
      and Katherine Crane and Estelle Adler volunteered to assist her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "All right," said Azalia, welcoming the suggestion. "Go and put on your
      bathing suits and bring a few more hanks of rope. Better <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>bring all there is there, for we
      probably can use it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine and Estelle hastened back to camp and in a short time returned,
      clad in their bathing suits and carrying several hundred feet of rope. In
      a few minutes they too were in the water and taking part in the
      exploration, protected against treacherous conditions as Azalia was
      protected.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In half an hour they had explored and pronounced safe as large a bathing
      place as their supply of rope would "fence in" and then began the
      "fencing" process. They cut several stout stakes six feet long and took
      them to the water's edge. Then the three girls in bathing suits assumed
      their new duty as water pile-drivers. They took one of the stakes at a
      time to a point along the proposed boundary line of the bathing place,
      also a heavy mallet that had been brought along for this purpose. A wooden
      mallet, by the way, was much more serviceable than a hatchet for such
      work, inasmuch as, if dropped, it would not sink, and moreover, it could
      be wielded with much less danger of injury to any of those working
      together in the water.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The first stake was taken to the northwest corner of the proposed
      inclosure. Katherine, who carried the mallet, gave it to Estelle and then
      climbed to a sitting posture on the latter's shoulders. Then Azalia stood
      the stake on its sharpened end and Katherine took hold of it with one hand
      and began to drive down <span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>on the
      upper end with the mallet, which Estelle handed back to her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was hard work for several reasons-hard for Estelle to maintain a steady
      and firm posture under the moving weight, hard for Katherine to wield the
      mallet with unerring strokes, hard to force the sharpened point into the
      well-packed bed of the lake. Katherine's right arm became very tired
      before she had driven the stake deep enough to insure a reasonable degree
      of firmness. While this task was being performed, the girls were still
      protected against the danger of being swept into deeper water by the ropes
      looped around their waists and held at the other ends by some of the girls
      on the sandy beach.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After this stake had been set firmly into the river bed, the girls
      returned to the shore and got another. This they took to another position
      about the same distance from the beach as the first one and drove it into
      the hardened loam under the water. The same process was continued until
      six such stakes had been driven.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then they took up the work of extending rope from stake to stake and
      completing the inclosure. The sags were supported by buoys of light wood
      tied to the rope, the two extreme ends of which were attached to stakes
      driven into the shore close to the water.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There, that is what I call a pretty good job," declared Miss Ladd gazing
      with proud satisfaction upon the result of more than three hours' steady
      work. "Whenever you <span class="pageno" id="Page_99">99</span>girls come
      out here to go bathing, you will be well warranted in assuming that you
      have earned your plunge."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All the girls by this time had their bathing suits on, but most of them
      were too tired to remain in the water any longer; so, by common consent,
      all adjourned to the camp to rest until suppertime.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, it appears that our activities have not yet aroused any special
      interest in the Graham household," Hazel Edwards observed as they began
      their march back toward the sheltered group of tents.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm not so certain of that," Miss Ladd replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why not?" Katherine inquired, while several of the girls who were near
      looked curiously at the Guardian.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Because I believe I have seen evidences of interest."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You have!" exclaimed two or three unguardedly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, girls, you are forgetting yourselves," said Miss Ladd warningly.
      "Remember that the first requisite of skill in your work here is caution.
      The reason I didn't say anything to you about what I saw is that I was
      afraid some of you might betray your interest in the fact that we were
      being watched. I saw two girls half hidden in a clump of bushes up near
      the top of the hill. I am sure they were watching us. They were there at
      least half an hour."

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Five of the members of the Camp Fire were present when Miss Ladd made this
      startling announcement that they had been watched secretly for a
      considerable time while roping off the limits of their swimming place. The
      other girls had taken the lead back to the camp and were a considerable
      distance ahead.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Are they watching us yet?" Azalia asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think not," the Guardian replied. "I haven't seen any sign of them
      during the last twenty minutes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How do you know they are girls?" Katherine inquired. "That's quite a
      distance to recognize ages."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, they may be old women, but I'll take a chance on a guess that they
      are not. The millinery I caught a peep at looked too chic for a
      grandmother. I've got pretty good long-distance eyes, I'll have you know,"
      Miss Ladd concluded smartly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was no little excitement among the other girls when this bit of news
      was communicated to them. But they had had good experience-training along
      the lines of self-control, and just a hint of the unwisdom of loud and
      extravagant remarks put them on their guard.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Some of the girls proposed that the plan of <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_101">101</span>building a bonfire in the evening be given up and
      nobody objected to this suggestion. All the girls felt more like resting
      under the shade of a tree than doing anything else, and those who had
      performed the more arduous tasks in the work of the afternoon were "too
      tired to eat supper," as one of them expressed it. So nobody felt like
      hunting through the timber for a big supply of firewood.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The atmosphere had become very warm in the afternoon, but the girls hardly
      noticed this condition until their work in the water was finished and they
      returned to the camp. After they had rested a while some of the girls read
      books and magazines, but little was done before supper.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After supper some of the girls, who felt more vigorous than those who had
      performed the more exhausting labor of the afternoon, revived the idea of
      a bonfire and were soon at work gathering a supply of wood. They busied
      themselves at this until nearly dusk and then called the other girls down
      to the water's edge, where on a large rocky ledge arrangements for the
      fire had been made.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All of the girls congratulated themselves now on the revival of the
      bonfire idea, for the mosquitos had become so numerous that comfort was no
      longer possible without some agency to drive them away. A bonfire was just
      the thing, although it would make the closely surrounding atmosphere
      uncomfortably warm.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>Even the girls who had
      performed the hardest tasks in the "fencing in" of their swimming place
      were by this time considerably rested and enjoyed watching the fire seize
      the wood and then leap up into the air as if for bigger prey.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let's sing," proposed Harriet Newcomb after the fire had grown into a
      roaring, crackling blaze, throwing a brilliant glow far out onto the
      water.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What shall it be?" asked Ethel Zimmerman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Burn Fire, Burn," Hazel Edwards proposed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Marion, you start it," Miss Ladd suggested, for Marion Stanlock was the
      "star" soprano of the Fire.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In a moment the well-trained voices of fourteen Camp Fire Girls were
      sending the clear operatic strains of a special adaptation of the fire
      chant of the Camp Fire ritual. The music had been composed and arranged by
      Marion Stanlock and Helen Nash a few months previously, and diligent
      practice had qualified the members of the Camp Fire to render the
      production impressively.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This song was succeeded by a chorus-rendering of a similar adaptation of
      the Fire Maker's Song. Then followed an impromptu program of miscellaneous
      songs, interspersed here and there with such musical expressions of
      patriotism as "America," "Star Spangled Banner," and "Over There," in
      evidence of a <span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>mindfulness of
      the part of the United States in the great international struggle for
      democracy.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Meanwhile dusk gathered heavier and heavier, the stars came out, and still
      the fire blazed up brightly and the girls continued to sing songs and tell
      stories and drink in the vigor and inspiration of the scene. At last,
      however, the Guardian announced that it was 9 o'clock, which was
      Flamingo's curfew, and there was a general move to extinguish the fire,
      which by this time had been allowed to burn low.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Suddenly all were startled by an astonishing occurrence. A heavy object,
      probably a stone as large as a man's fist, fell in the heap of embers,
      scattering sparks and burning sticks in all directions. There was a chorus
      of screams, and a frantic examination, by the girls, of one another's
      clothes to see if any of them were afire.

    <p class="c006">
      "Who in the world do you suppose did that?" Hazel Edwards exclaimed, as
      she hastily examined her own clothes and then quickly struck out a spark
      that clung to the skirt of Azalia Atwood.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Quick, girls," cried Miss Ladd; "did any of you do that?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a chorus of indignant denials. No room for doubt remained now
      that the missile had been hurled by someone outside the semicircle near
      the bonfire.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All eyes were turned back toward the timber a short distance away, but not
      a sign of a human being could they see in that direction.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "If we'd been on the other side of the bonfire, we'd have got that shower
      of sparks right in our faces and all over us," Katherine Crane said
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We ought to find out who threw that rock, or whatever it was," Ethel
      Zimmerman declared. "It must be a very dangerous person, who ought to be
      taken care of."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "If that sort of thing is repeated many times, some of us probably will
      have to be taken care of," observed Julietta Hyde.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Listen!" Miss Ladd interrupted, and the occasion of her interruption did
      not call for explanation. All heard it. A moment later it was repeated.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>"Wohelo!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No Camp Fire Girl ever made such a noise as that," said Helen Nash
      disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It sounds like a man's voice," Azalia Atwood remarked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll bet a Liberty Bond that it is a man," ventured Ruth Hazelton.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Have you a Liberty Bond?" asked Helen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm paying for one out of my allowance," Ruth replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Just then the "noise" was repeated, a hoarse hollow vocalization of the
      Camp Fire Watchword. This time it seemed to be farther away.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The person who gave that call threw the missile into our bonfire," said
      Miss Ladd in a tone of conviction. "If he bothers us any more we'll find
      out who he is."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girls now turned their attention again to the fire. Several pails of
      water were carried from the lake and dashed into the embers until not a
      spark remained. Then they returned to their tents and to bed, although
      apprehensive of further disturbance before morning.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But they heard nothing more of the intruder that night.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Shortly after sunup, the girls arose, put on their bathing suits, and went
      down to the beach for a before-breakfast plunge. Marie Crismore and Violet
      Munday reached the water's edge first, and presently they were giving
      utterance to such unusual expressions, indicative seemingly of anything
      but pleasure <span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>that the other
      girls hastened down to see what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was no need of explanation. The evidence was before them. The stakes
      that had been driven into the bed of the lake to hold the rope intended to
      indicate the safety limit had been pulled out and thrown upon the shore.
      The rope itself had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There surely are some malicious mischief makers in this vicinity," Helen
      Nash observed. "I suppose the person who did that was the one who threw a
      stone into our bonfire and hooted our watchword so hideously."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What shall we do?" Violet Munday questioned. "We can't let this sort of
      thing go on indefinitely."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We must complain to the authorities," Ernestine Johanson suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you suppose they would do anything?" Estelle Adler asked. "I
      understand it's very hard to get these country officials busy on anything
      except a murder or a robbery."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Then we must organize a series of relief watches and take the law into
      our own hands," Katherine proposed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Spoken like a true soldier," commented Miss Ladd approvingly. "I was
      going to suggest something of the same sort, although not quite so much
      like anarchy."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Where do you suppose they hid that rope?" Marion Stanlock inquired.
      "Somebody probably needed a clothesline.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Here come some people who may be able <span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>to
      throw some light on the situation," said Marion.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All looked up and saw two girls apparently in their "upper teens," dressed
      more suitably for an afternoon tea than a rustic outing. The latter were
      descending the wooded hill-shore, and had just emerged from a thick
      arborial growth into a comparatively clear area a hundred yards away.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Sh!" Katherine warned quickly. "Be careful what you say or do. Those are
      the Graham girls."

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "They're early risers; we must say that much for them," observed Katherine
      in a low voice. "We must give them credit for not lying in bed until 10
      o'clock and, and--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And for dressing for an afternoon party before breakfast," Helen Nash
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Isn't it funny!" Hazel Edwards said with a suppressed titter. "I wonder
      if they are going in bathing."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Keep still, girls," Miss Ladd interposed. "They're getting pretty near.
      Let's not pay too much attention to them. Let them seek our acquaintance,
      not we theirs. The advantage will be on our side then."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At this suggestion of the Guardian, the girls turned their attention again
      to the conditions about their bathing beach. A moment later Katherine made
      a discovery that centered all interest in unaffected earnest upon the
      latest depredation of their enemy, or enemies. With a stick she fished out
      one end of a small rope and was soon hauling away at what appeared to be
      the "clothes line" they had used to indicate the safety limits of their
      bathing place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, conditions are not as bad as they might be," said Miss Ladd, as she
      took hold to assist at hauling the line out of the water. <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>"We have the stakes and the rope
      and can put them back into place."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Would you mind telling us what has happened?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      These words drew the attention of the Camp Fire Girls away from the object
      discovered in the water and to the speaker, who was one of the older of
      the urbanely clad summer resorters from the Graham cottage.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Someone has been guilty of some very malicious mischief," Miss Ladd
      replied. "We had roped in a bathing place after examining it and finding
      it safe for those who are not good swimmers, and you see what has been
      done with our work. The stakes were pulled up and the rope hidden in the
      water. Fortunately we have just discovered the rope."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Isn't that mean!" said the younger girl, whom the campers surmised
      correctly to be Olga Graham.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Mean is no name for it," the other Graham girl declared vengefully.
      "Haven't you any idea who did it?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "None that is very tangible," Miss Ladd replied. "There was a mysterious
      prowler near our camp last evening, but we didn't catch sight of him. He
      threw a heavy stone into our bonfire and knocked the sparks and embers in
      every direction, but he kept himself hidden. A little later we heard a
      hideous call in the timbers, which we were pretty sure was intended to
      frighten us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>"That's strange," commented
      the older of the visitors.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Maybe it's the ghost," suggested Olga with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Ghost!" repeated several of the Camp Fire Girls in unison.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I was just joking," the younger Graham girl explained hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why did you suggest a ghost even as a joke?" inquired Katherine. The
      utterance of the word ghost, together with the probability that there was
      a neighborhood story behind it, forced upon her imagination an irrational
      explanation of the strange occurrences of the last evening.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, I didn't mean anything by it," Olga reassured, but her words seemed
      to come with a slightly forced unnaturalness. "But there has been some
      talk about a ghost around here, you know."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Did anybody ever see it?" asked Hazel Edwards.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not that I know of," avowed Olga. "Of course, I don't believe in such
      things, but, then, you never can tell. It might be a half-witted person,
      and I'm sure I don't know which I'd rather meet after dark-a ghost or a
      crazy man."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is there a crazy man running loose around here?" Ernestine Johanson
      inquired with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There must be," Olga declared with a suggestion of awe in her voice. "If
      it isn't a ghost-and <span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>I don't
      believe in such things-it must be somebody escaped from a lunatic asylum."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I saw something mysterious moving through the woods near our cottage one
      night," Addie Graham interposed at this point. "Nobody else in the family
      would believe me when I told them about it. It looked like a man in a long
      white robe and long hair and a long white beard. It was moonlight and I
      was looking out of my bedroom window. Suddenly this strange being appeared
      near the edge of the timber. He was looking toward the house, and I
      suppose he saw me, for he picked up a stone and threw it at the window
      where I stood. It fell a few feet short of its mark, and then the ghost or
      the insane man-call him what you please-turned and ran away."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My sister told us about that next morning, and we all laughed at her,"
      said Olga, continuing the account. "I told her to go out and find the
      stone, and she went out and picked one up just about where she said the
      stone that was thrown at her fell."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Were there any other stones near there?" Marion Stanlock inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We looked around specially to find out if there were any others near, but
      didn't find any," Olga answered. "Addie-that's my sister-had the laugh on
      us all after that."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you live in the cottage over there?" Ethel Zimmerman inquired,
      pointing toward the Graham summer residence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes," Addie replied. "Our name is Graham. <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_112">112</span>We were very much interested when we learned that
      a company of Camp Fire Girls were camping near us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't you girls camp out any?" Katherine asked with the view of possibly
      bringing out an explanation of the Graham girls' attire, which seemed
      suited more for promenading along a metropolitan boulevard than for any
      other purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, dear no," Olga answered somewhat deprecatingly. "We'd like to well
      enough, you know, but we're in society so much that we just don't have
      time."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine wanted to ask the Graham girls if they were going to a stylish
      reception before breakfast, but restrained the impulse.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Both Katherine and Hazel recognized Addie as the girl whom, on their first
      trip to Stony Point, they had seen handle roughly the little boy they
      believed to be Glen Irving, the grandnephew of Mrs. Hutchins' late husband
      in whose interests they made the present trip of inspection. Whether or
      not she recognized among the campers the two girls to whom she had behaved
      so rudely on that occasion did not appear from her manner, which was all
      sweetness now. She continued her social discourse thus:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I really wish society did not demand so much of our time, and I'm sure my
      sister feels the same way about it. There's nothing we'd like better than
      to become Camp Fire Girls and live close to nature, you know, just the
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>way you girls live. Truly it
      must be delightful. But when you become an integral figure in society (she
      really said integral), you are regarded as indispensable, and society
      won't let go of you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      None of the Camp Fire Girls attempted to reply to this speech. Their plan
      was to bring about an appearance of friendship between them and the
      Grahams in order that they might associate with the family that had
      custody of the little boy in whose interests they were working. Any
      attempt on their part, they felt, to discuss "society" from the point of
      view of the Graham girls must result in a betrayal of their utter lack of
      sympathy with this "social indispensability" of such helpless society
      victims.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We'd like, however, to do something for you in your unfortunate
      situation," Addie Graham continued with a gush of seeming friendliness.
      "I'm sure my brother James-he's 16 years old-would be glad to assist you
      in any way he can. I'm going to send him down here, if you say the word,
      to help you extend that rope around your swimming place. He's a very handy
      boy, and it would be much better for you to let him do the work than to
      perform such a laborious task yourselves."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Thank you ever so much," returned Miss Ladd with a warmth that seemed to
      indicate acceptance of the offer. The truth was that anything which tended
      to increase friendly <span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>relations
      between them and the Grahams was acceptable.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll send him around today," the older Graham girl promised. "We must
      hurry back now for breakfast. We were just out for an early morning
      constitutional, you know."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Come and see us any time you wish," Miss Ladd urged. "You'll always be
      welcome. We haven't made the acquaintance of anybody around here yet. Come
      over and help us eat one of our constitutional luncheons, or suppers. We
      have real picnics every day, the jolliest kind of times-except when the
      ghost walks. Maybe you can help us catch the ghost, also."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Maybe we can," said Addie. "Well, good-bye. You girls come and see us,
      too."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Thank you," was the acknowledgment uttered by several of the members of
      Flamingo Camp Fire as the two Misses Graham stepped primly in their
      French-heel shoes over the uneven ground and returned homeward along a
      diagonal course up the side of the hill-shore of Twin One.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      All the members of Flamingo Camp Fire gathered close together on the sandy
      beach after the departure of the two Graham girls and held a low-toned
      discussion of the situation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There was only one thing missing this morning," Hazel Edwards observed.
      "That was the perfume. I suppose they didn't have time to spill it on in
      proper proportions."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I wonder why they came down here at this time of day?" said Harriet
      Newcomb. "There must be something in the air."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I bet they never got up this early before unless their house was afire,"
      Ethel Zimmerman ventured.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you suppose they wanted to be on hand to witness our discomfiture when
      we discovered what had been done to our swimming place?" Azalia Atwood
      asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That would imply that they knew who did it and may even have been a party
      to the plot," Miss Ladd reasoned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And why not?" Azalia returned. "They don't look to me, for a moment, to
      be above it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I feel like a miserable hypocrite," Katherine declared with a sarcastic
      smile. "I'm not used to extending warm expressions of friendship <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_116">116</span>to people for whom I haven't any
      use and asking them to call and see me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Remember you're a spy now," said Helen Nash slyly. "When engaged in a
      praiseworthy spy work, always remember your mother and the pantry and the
      fist in the jam, if you have any doubt as to the worthiness of your
      occupation."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Enough said," Katherine announced, "I'm convinced. The jam is well spiced
      and I smell it already. I shall expect to find it on somebody's fist."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girls did not forego their morning plunge because of the removal of
      the "safety line," but were careful to keep well within the approximate
      limit which they remembered fairly well. After about fifteen minutes in
      the water they returned to the camp and donned their khaki middies; then
      they had breakfast.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The breakfast dishes had not long been washed and put away when another
      caller arrived at the camp. Although not unheralded, the appearance of
      this new arrival was a surprise to all the girls, for they had not rested
      much importance upon the promise of Addie Graham to send her brother to
      them to offer his assistance in repairing the damage done by some
      mischief-maker in the night before.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The young male scion of the Graham family appeared so suddenly before the
      eyes of the girl campers that some of them afterward expressed the
      suspicion that he walked timidly on his tiptoes all the way from his home
      to the <span class="pageno" id="Page_117">117</span>camp. Indeed all the
      members of Flamingo Fire have today a decided impression that the sound of
      his voice was the first notice they had of his approach.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Whether this impression be a true one or not, that voice was enough to
      compel memory of it ahead of anything else. It was the most effeminately
      high-pitched voice the girls had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Excuse me, young ladies, but my name is James Graham, Jr.," squeaked the
      treble clef.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a general start throughout the camp. Most of the girls were
      seated upon the grassy plot within the crescent arrangement of the tents
      and engaged in their forenoon routine, and several of them actually
      dropped their craft work into their laps so great was their surprise.
      Ethel Zimmerman uttered a little cry of astonishment in almost the same
      key as the announcement of the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter was almost as effeminate in appearance as in voice. First, he
      was very much overgrown and fleshy. He probably weighed 150 pounds. His
      face was round and very pale, and his eyes were not over-endowed with
      expression. He wore a "peaches-and-cream" two-piece suit and a panama
      fedora and carried a delicate bamboo cane.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My two thoughtful sisters info'med me that you young ladies were in need
      of the assistance of a man, and I volunteered to offer my aid," continued
      young Master Graham.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh dear me," replied Katherine; "it would <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_118">118</span>be a shame to put you to so much trouble. We thank
      you ever so much for your offer, but we'd much rather retain the
      friendship of your folks by urging you not to insist. If you really must
      be so good as you suggest, you might go back and send your hostler or
      chauffeur, but tell him to bring a pair of rubber boots that reach to his
      ears."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This rather enigmatical answer puzzled the not very quick-witted James,
      Jr., and his chin dropped.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You see, we want a pile-driver out in the lake to sink some posts into
      the submarine earth," Katherine continued. "But, by the way, come to think
      of it, you might help us wonderfully if you have a rowboat and would lend
      it to us for an hour or two."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Sure I've got a boat," replied the "would-(not)-be ladies' aid," as one
      of the girls afterward dubbed him. The tone of relief with which he now
      spoke was unmistakable. "I'll go and row it right over to you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We won't want it until about 11 o'clock," said Miss Ladd. "If you need it
      between now and then you'd better wait."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh we won't want it all day," James, Jr., returned reassuringly. "I'll
      bring it right away."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I hope he doesn't tip his boat over on his 'high C'" Hazel Edwards said
      generously, as the caller disappeared in the timber. "He might be drowned
      in the billows of his own voice."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>"That's his name-High C,"
      declared Estelle Adler enthusiastically. "I refuse to recognize him by any
      other name. Dear me, girls, did you ever in all your born days hear such a
      voice?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No," cried several in chorus.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He's just the dearest thing I ever saw," declared Ernestine Johanson,
      making a face as sour as the reputation of a crabapple.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At this moment the discussion of "High C" was dropped as suddenly as "it"
      had appeared upon the scene. Another arrival claimed the interest of the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was a little boy about ten years old, clad in steel-gray Palm Beach
      knickerbockers and golf cap, but not at all happy in appearance. He was a
      good looking youth, but there was no sprightly cheerfulness in his
      countenance. He seemed nervous and on the alert.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My goodness!" exclaimed Hazel Edwards; "that's Glen Irving, the little
      boy we--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine, who was seated close to Hazel, cut the latter's utterance short
      by clapping her hand over the speaker's mouth.

        CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class="c002">THE RUNAWAY.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The boy was excited. Evidently he was laboring under anything but normal
      conditions. He had appeared very suddenly around the north end of the
      bluff which sheltered the camp on the east. "High C" or "Jimmie Junior,"
      as the girls from now on referred to young Graham, had left the camp
      around the south extremity of the bluff.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The youth in Palm Beach knickerbockers fairly rushed from the thicket
      north of the camp and directly toward the girls, all of whom jumped to
      their feet in astonishment. The newcomer did not slacken his pace, but ran
      up to the group of startled campers as if seeking their protection from a
      "Bogy Man." And as he stopped in the midst of the group which circled
      around him almost as excited as he, the little fellow looked back as if
      expecting to behold some frightful looking object bearing down upon him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I ran away," were his first words; "so-so they couldn't beat me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Who wanted to beat you?" inquired Miss Ladd sympathetically, leaning over
      and taking him gently by the hand.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Mom-an' Ad.-an' Olg.-an' Jim-they all hit me," he replied, his eyes
      flashing with anger. "Mom locked me in a room, but I <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_121">121</span>opened a window an' clum out."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Did they beat you today?" Hazel Edwards questioned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No," replied the youth with a puzzled look; "they don't want you to know
      they whipped me. They stopped it after you came and after a man came and
      told 'em not to."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Who is the man?" Hazel asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't know. I heard his name, but I forgot."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Was it Langford?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, that's it-Langford. He told 'em all to be good as pie to me while
      you was here. They thought I was asleep, but I was just pretendin'."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Did Mr. Langford say why they must be good to you while we were here?"
      asked Katherine.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I guess he did," the boy replied slowly. "He said somebody'd take me away
      and Mom 'u'd lose a lot o' money."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's just what we thought," Hazel declared.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What else did you overhear?" Katherine inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They're goin' to be awful nice and awful mean."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Awful nice and awful mean," Katherine repeated. "That's interesting. What
      do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They're goin' to be awful nice to your face, but mean on the sly."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Have they done anything mean yet?" Miss <span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>Ladd
      interposed, having in mind the depredations of the night before.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't know," the boy answered. "They were talkin' about doing somethin'
      last night, and the man and Jim went out together."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You don't know what they proposed to do?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No-just somethin', anything they could."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What is your name, little boy?" Hazel asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Glen" was the answer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Glen what?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Glen Graham."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Isn't it Glen Irving?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boy looked doubtfully at his interrogator.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't know," he replied slowly. "I guess not."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Didn't you ever hear the name Irving before?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boy's face brightened up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That was my papa's name," he said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, I want to ask you an important question," said Miss Ladd
      impressively. "Try your best to tell us all you can, and don't tell any of
      the Grahams you were down here talking to us. We won't forget you. If they
      beat you any more come, and tell us if you can get away. We'll have the
      police after them. But be sure to keep this to yourself. Now, here's the
      question I want you to answer: Did anybody <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_123">123</span>outside of the Graham family ever see them beat
      you?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Sure," Glen replied quickly. "Byron Scott did. So did Mrs. Pruitt and Guy
      Davis and Mark Taylor."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Where do they live?" was Miss Ladd's next question.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Byron lives here, so does Mrs. Pruitt. Guy and Mark live in Baltimore."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do they live near the Graham's home in Baltimore?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, right in the same block. Mark lives next door."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Good. Now, Glen, we are going to take you back to Mrs. Graham. We haven't
      any right to keep you here, but if they beat you any more, we will
      complain to the police and take you away never to come back to them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, I wish you would," exclaimed the little fellow, throwing his arms
      around the neck of the Guardian who had seated herself on the grass before
      him. "I don't want them to scare you with a ghost."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Scare us with a ghost!" Miss Ladd repeated in astonishment. "What do you
      mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They said--" the boy began, but his explanation was interrupted in a
      manner so confusing that the group of Camp Fire Girls might easily have
      wondered if the world were suddenly assuming all the absurdities of a
      clownish paradise in order to be consistent with what was now taking
      place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>Addie Graham, the girl of
      ultra-style and perfume who had behaved so rudely to little Glen when she
      discovered the runaway with Katherine and Hazel in the woods, suddenly
      dashed into the deeply interested group of Camp Fire inquisitors, seized
      the boy in her arms, kissed him with apparent passionate fondness, and
      addressed him with a gush of endearment that must have brought tears to
      the eyes of an unsophisticated listener.

        CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A LITTLE SCRAPPER.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      "Oh, you dear little brother, you dear darling child," almost sobbed Addie
      as she seized Glen Irving in her arms and began to shower kisses on his
      unwilling face.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boy shrunk away, or into as small a compass as he was able, to escape
      from the "affectionate attack." Plainly it was anything but pleasing to
      him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The "attack," however, did not cease in response to his protest. Addie
      held onto her captive with all her strength, at the same time attempting
      to soothe his wrath or fear, or both, with as many kisses as she could
      force in between the boy's belligerent arms. Glen, conscious of the
      presence of friends who, he believed, would go to any extreme to assist
      him, fought as he had never fought before, desperately, viciously. He used
      his fists and fingernails to good purpose and pulled Addie's hair until it
      presented a ludicrous appearance of disarrangement.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Realizing that the boy's actions might prove harmful to his cause if this
      affair should ever be contested in the courts, Miss Ladd decided to take a
      hand and do what she could to pacify the young heir who had suddenly been
      transformed into a veritable wildcat. She <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_126">126</span>had no doubt that there was good cause in his past
      experience for the development of such character in him, but expediency
      demanded that it be checked at once.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Here, let me take him," Miss Ladd urged as she laid her hands on his
      shoulders and attempted to draw him away. A few gentle words and an
      exhibition of a kind persuasiveness of manner brought success. She drew
      the lad back some distance and tried to reason with him, whereupon he
      burst into convulsive sobbing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      His sobs were not a new expression of an outburst of passion. Miss Ladd
      was certain of this. Little Glen was weeping not because anger "opened the
      floodgates of his soul," but because of some picture of dread in his past
      experience which he feared would be repeated in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But Addie Graham was not equal to the occasion. The veneer of gentleness
      that she had put on could not withstand the deep-seated spitefulness of
      her nature, and as she observed a severe scratch on one hand and felt the
      disarrangement of her hair, she yielded impulsively to vengefulness of
      spirit that was boiling within her and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The miserable little pest! Just wait till I get you home, Glen Graham,
      and I'll--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She stopped right there, much to the disappointment of the eagerly
      listening Camp Fire Girls who fully expected her to open an avenue to
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>the very evidence for which
      they were looking.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why!" she continued, with a desperate effort to control her temper. "I
      never knew him to act that way before. He's usually such a-such a-sweet
      dispositioned little dear. I don't know what to make of it. He took me
      completely by surprise. I don't understand it-I don't know what to make of
      it-I can't understand the little-the little-d-dear."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is strange, very strange," Miss Ladd agreed, purposing, for policy's
      sake, to help the girl out of her predicament.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Come to sister, Glennie dear," Addie continued, after she had succeeded
      in rearranging her hair and restoring her hat to its normal position on
      her head. "Don't you know sister loves you just lots? Why did you run
      away? Come back home and sister will give you some candy, just lots of it.
      Come on, now, that's a good little boy."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't want your candy and you ain't my sister, and I won't go back.
      You'll beat me, and mom'll beat me and everybody else'll beat me. Don't
      let her take me back, please don't," Glen concluded, turning his face
      pleadingly toward Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, you must go back, Glen," the Guardian replied, reproachfully. "That's
      your home, don't you know? Where in the world will you go if you don't go
      back home? Think of it-no <span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>place
      in the world to go, no place in the world."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a tone of awe in the young woman's voice that impressed the boy.
      He cooled down considerably and looked meditatively at his monitor.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They'll beat me," he protested earnestly. "They'll tie me to a bed post
      and strap me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why, how perfectly terrible!" Addie exclaimed. "I never heard of such a
      thing. I can't understand such remarks."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'll tell you what we'll do," Katherine suggested reassuringly. "We'll
      all go back to the house with you and fix everything up nice. They won't
      beat you, I'm sure. Come on, Miss Graham, we'll help you, if you don't
      think we're intruding."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Addie did not know how to reply and did not attempt to. She started toward
      home and the Camp Fire Girls followed her, Miss Ladd leading the battling
      runaway by the hand.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Glen was considerably bewildered and apparently submissive during the
      journey homeward. He said little, and when he spoke, it was only a short
      reply to something said to him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At the door of the cottage, they were met by Mrs. Graham, to whom Addie
      introduced them. None of the girls were well impressed by the woman's
      appearance or manner. She affected the same ungenuine interest and
      affection for Glen that had characterized Addie's <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_129">129</span>manner toward him. But they managed to bring about
      a condition more or less reassuring to the boy and left him, with secret
      misgivings, in the custody of the family which they held more than ever
      under suspicion.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We've got to do some real spy work now," said Miss Ladd after they had
      reached their camp again. "We've got to find out what is going on in that
      house when those people have no suspicion that they are being watched."

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The thirteen Camp Fire Girls and their Guardian are hardly to be censured
      because they did little more work of a routine nature that day. One could
      hardly expect them to fix their minds upon any "even tenor" occupation
      while the thrills of recent developments supplied so much stimulus for
      discussion of future prospect.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were careful in these discussions not to leave open any possibility
      of their being overheard. Their conversations were always held in low
      tones and in places where it would be difficult for any of the members of
      the Graham family to find positions of concealment near enough to overhear
      what was being said.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      One thing decided upon was in line with Miss Ladd's declaration that they
      must find out "what was going on in the Graham house," having reference,
      of course, to the treatment received there by little Glen in view of his
      violent protest against being returned to the care and custody of the
      people whom he charged with acts of cruelty toward himself. A scouting
      expedition was planned for the evening, the "official scouts" of the
      Fire-Katherine and Hazel-being delegated to this work. Katherine proposed
      that two others be selected to assist them, and Miss Ladd suggested <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>that they choose their assistants
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We'll think it over and pick them before suppertime," said Katherine
      after conferring with Hazel.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The result was that before sundown Azalia Atwood and Ernestine Johanson
      had been added to the spy squad. Their selection came as a result of
      general discussions of the work in prospect, in the course of which both
      Azalia and Ernestine made several suggestions that were regarded as clever
      and helpful for the scouting plans.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Shortly after the girls returned from the Graham cottage to their camp,
      "Jimmie Junior" of the "treble clef voice" appeared with the announcement
      that he had brought his boat to the Camp Fire landing and moored it by
      tying the painter to a projecting rock. They thanked him and proceeded at
      once with the task of restoring the safety-guard line to their bathing
      place. All put on their bathing suits and went down to the beach.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      With the aid of the boat their work was much easier than it had been the
      first time. It is no easy performance for one person to sit on the
      shoulders of another and wield a mallet on the upper end of a stake held
      by a third person in water arm-pit deep. If you doubt this assertion, just
      try it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Well, this difficult feat was unnecessary this time. The stakes, rope, and
      mallet were put into the boat, and three of the girls got in <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>and rowed out to the point where
      the southwest stake had been driven before. Then two of them plunged
      overboard and, while one of these steadied the boat and the other held the
      stake in position, the girl in the boat drove it firmly into the sand-clay
      bed of the lake.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This operation was repeated until the supports of the buoy-line were all
      restored. Then the rope was stretched from stake to stake and wooden buoys
      attached as before.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The work was speedily performed and then the girls all had a good swim.
      When they returned to their camp, it was lunch time and the "gastronomic
      committee," as Harriet, the "walking dictionary," had dubbed the
      commissary department, got busy. During the meal, which they ate on a
      "newspaper tablecloth," picnic-style, the subject of organized
      self-protection against further depredations was discussed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I believe we ought to establish a relief watch system to be kept up all
      night every night as long as there seems to be any danger of our being
      molested by prowlers like those who paid us a visit last night," Estelle
      announced.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What would we do if we caught anybody at any mischief?" asked Azalia.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We'd sail right into 'em and give 'em Hail Columbia," declared Hazel like
      a vigilance committee chairman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, we'd pull their hair," said Marie Crismore.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>"And scratch their eyes out,"
      Ernestine chimed in.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And boo-shoo 'em away," added Julietta Hyde.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I'm positively ashamed of you for talking that way," Miss Ladd
      interposed. "You're laughing at yourselves because you are girls. Now, you
      ought not to do that, even in fun. How many of you can do some real boys'
      stunts just as well as the boys can?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can swim half a mile," announced Hazel.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can do a fly-away from the horizontal bar," declared Violet Munday.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can run a hundred-yard dash in thirteen seconds," said Ernestine; "and
      that's better than lots of boys can do it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I can throw a ball like a boy," said Helen Nash.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "So can I"-this from Marion Stanlock.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, several of us can do that," Katherine declared. "We've played ball
      with the boys. But now you're getting close to what I was driving at.
      We'll proceed to gather a supply of ammunition."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Ammunition!" several exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Surely," Katherine replied. "We'll get it down on the beach."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, I get you," said Estelle. "You mean--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Rocks," cried Marie, getting the word in ahead of Estelle.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's it," Katherine admitted. "We'll <span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>shower
      rocks at anybody that makes us any more trouble."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Very ingenious," Miss Ladd said approvingly. "If those persons who
      visited us last night come again, they'll get a warm reception."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And a hard one," Marion supplemented.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I have another idea," Helen announced, and everybody turned attention to
      her. "I have some heavy rubber bands in my grip. I always carry them
      because they come in very handy sometimes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What can you do with them?" Estelle asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What do you think?" Helen returned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I know," cried Ethel Zimmerman. "Make catapults with them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Good!" several of the girls exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The boys call them slingshots," said the Guardian.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How do you make a slingshot?" Julietta inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I know," Marion announced. "You cut a forked stick, like the letter 'Y.'
      Then you tie two rubber bands to it, one to each fork. Between the other
      ends of the bands you tie a little sack, or shallow pocket, made of
      leather or strong cloth. You put a stone in this pocket and pull it back,
      stretching the rubber bands, take aim, and let it fly."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You must have had experience making those things," Katherine suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No, I never made one," Marion replied; <span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>"but
      I've watched my cousin make them and shoot them, too. He was very skillful
      at it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can you shoot a catapult?" Katherine inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I think I can," Marion answered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Good," said Katherine. "We'll make several, and those who can't throw
      stones can use slingshots."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That was a very busy afternoon for this warlike group of girls. While the
      luncheon dishes were being washed and put away, Katherine and Hazel rowed
      the boat back to the Graham landing, thanked "Jimmie Junior" for its use,
      accepted with solemn countenances his "high-C" "You're welcome," and
      returned to their camp. Then the work of manufacturing arms and
      ammunition, in anticipation of another midnight invasion, began.

        CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br /><span class="c002">THE GHOST.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Before the "preparedness program" of the afternoon was started, Miss Ladd
      addressed the group of Camp Fire Girls thus, speaking in low tone, of
      course, in order that she might not be overheard by any eavesdropper who
      might be in hiding in the vicinity:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, we want to do this thing right. How many of you feel that you can
      throw a stone a considerable distance and accurately?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine, Helen, Marion and Violet held up their hands.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How many of you would like to use catapults?" was the Guardian's next
      question.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The hands of Harriet, Marie, Ethel, and Ruth went up promptly. A moment
      later Estelle and Ernestine also put up theirs.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I believe I could learn how," said Estelle.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We don't want too much demonstration around here this afternoon," Miss
      Ladd warned. "Everything must proceed quietly and as if nothing unusual
      were taking place. How many rubber bands have you, Helen?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, a dozen or twenty," the latter replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, we'll proceed to cut half a dozen Y-forks and make them into
      catapults. We'll start out at once. Hazel, you get a hatchet, and, Marie,
      you get a saw; the rest of you get your combination knives."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>In a few minutes they were in
      the thick of the timber, searching the small trees and saplings for
      Y-forks to serve as catapult handles. In half an hour they returned with a
      dozen of varying degree of symmetry and excellence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then the work of assembling the parts of these miniature engines of war
      began. Some of the girls exhibited a good deal of mechanical skill, while
      others made moves and suggestions so awkward as to occasion much laughter.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, anyway," said Marie after she had been merrily criticised for
      sewing up the "mouth" of a "pocket" so narrowly that a stone could hardly
      fly out of it; "there are lots of boys who would make a worse job sewing
      on a button. Don't you remember last winter at a button-sewing contest,
      Paul Wetzler cast the thread over and over and over the side of the
      button-and he didn't know any better."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That's a very convenient way to dodge a joke on you, Marie," said Violet.
      "But just because boys don't know anything is no reason why we shouldn't."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Whew! some slam at me," Marie exclaimed. "I'm very properly squelched."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After half a dozen catapults had been made, the girls practiced slinging
      stones for an hour and several of them developed considerable skill. In
      this way it was determined who should have the preference in the use of
      these weapons.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Then at the suggestion of Miss Ladd, a <span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>dozen
      slings were made to be tied about the waist for carrying a supply of
      stones, some the size of an egg, for throwing with the hand and pebbles
      for use in the catapults. After these were completed, the girls went down
      to the beach and gathered a plentiful supply and took them back to the
      camp. Then a score or two of these stones were deposited in the slings,
      and the latter were put in convenient places in the tents on short notice.
      The catapults also were turned over to those of the girls who proved most
      capable of using them skillfully.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The last item of preparations on the program of the day consisted of
      completing plans for a succession of night watch reliefs. As Katherine,
      Hazel, Azalia, and Ernestine were assigned to special scout duty
      immediately after dusk, they were excused from assignment on any of the
      reliefs. This left ten girls among whom the watches might be divided,
      which was done in the following manner:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The eight sleeping hours from 9 P.M. to 5 A.M. were divided into live
      watches of equal length and assignments were made thus:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      First watch: Marion Stanlock and Helen Nash. Second watch: Ruth Hazelton
      and Ethel Zimmerman. Third watch: Violet Munday and Harriet Newcomb.
      Fourth watch: Julietta Hyde and Marie Crismore. Fifth watch: Estelle Adler
      and the Guardian, Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nothing further of particular interest took <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_139">139</span>place during the rest of the day, except that
      shortly before suppertime Addie and Olga Graham, both dressed "fit to
      kill," called at the camp and thanked the girls for their assistance in
      getting "their brother" back home.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Is he all right now?" Hazel inquired with genuine concern.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes, he's fine," Addie replied. "You see he has spells of that kind every
      now and then, and we don't know what to make of it. But today's was the
      worst spell he ever had."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Don't you do anything for him?" Hazel asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What can we do?" Addie returned. "He isn't sick. I'm afraid it's just a
      little distemper. There is absolutely no reason for it."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Miss Ladd asked the Graham girls to remain at the camp for supper, but
      they "begged to be excused on account of a pressing social engagement."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After darkness had fallen as heavily as could be expected on a clear,
      though moonless night, the four scouts set out through the timber toward
      the Graham cottage. All of them carried flashlights and clubs which might
      easily have been mistaken in the dark for mere walking sticks. The clubs
      were for protection against dogs or any other living being which might
      exhibit hostility toward them. Katherine and Hazel had also two of the
      rubber-band catapults, as they had exhibited no little skill, for novices,
      in the use of them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other girls built a small fire near the <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_140">140</span>tents, to keep the mosquitos away, and sat around
      it chatting and waited for the scouts to return. Miss Ladd insisted, as
      soon as dusk began to gather, that they bring out their "ammunition" from
      the tents and keep it close at hand for immediate use if anything should
      happen to require it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And something did happen, something of quite unexpected and startling
      character. The scouts had been gone about half an hour and the night had
      settled down to a blanket of darkness on the earth, a sprinkle of
      starlight in the sky, the croaking of frogs, the songs of katydids and the
      occasional ripple of water on the lake shore. A poet might have breathed a
      sigh of delightful awe. Well, the girls were pleasureably impressed with
      scene and the sounds, if they were not exactly delighted, and the awe was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It came without warning and was before them very suddenly. It was in the
      form of a man in a long, white robe, long white hair and whiskers, the
      latter reaching almost to his waist. He stalked, stiffly, unemotionally
      out of the darkness south of the camp and across the open space within
      thirty feet of the fire, where sat the startled, chill-thrilled group of
      girls, speechless with something akin to fear and momentarily powerless to
      shake off the spell that held them as rigid as statues.

        CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A BUMP ON THE HEAD.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Suddenly Helen Nash's memory served her so well that she regained control
      of her wits with a shock. Here is what she remembered:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't want them to scare you with a ghost"-these words uttered by
      little Glen just before his warning speech was interrupted by the
      appearance of Addie Graham at the girls' camp.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That recollection was enough for Helen. There was nothing tenuous,
      elusively subtle, or impenetrably mysterious any longer about the ghostly
      apparition. Little Glen had something very clear and definite in his mind
      when he made that remark.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Her muscles having relaxed from their rigid strain of superstitious
      suspense, Helen reached for the "ammunition sling" that she had placed
      beside her and drew therefrom one of the catapults they had made in the
      afternoon, also a pebble about the size of a marble, and fitted the latter
      in the pocket of the weapon. Then she drew back the pocket and the pebble,
      stretching the rubber bands as far as she could extend them, and took
      careful aim.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Helen had practiced with this weapon a good deal in the last two or three
      hours and acquired considerable proficiency for so short <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>a period of experience. Moreover,
      she was skilled in amateur archery and could pull a bow with a strong
      right arm. This experience, together with a general systematic athletic
      training at school, rendered her particularly well adapted for her present
      undertaking.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other girls, under the spell of awe-fascination which had seized and
      held Helen before it was broken by a sudden jog of her memory, knew
      nothing of what was going on in their midst until they heard the snap of
      the rubber bands. And doubtless it would have taken them considerable time
      to fathom it had the pebble-shooter's aim not proved to be remarkably
      good. It struck the "ghost" on the head.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Of course even Helen could not follow the pebble through the air with her
      eyes, nor could she see where it struck, but other unmistakable evidence
      informed her as to the trueness of her aim and the effect of the blow. A
      sharp thud informed her that she had hit something of substantial
      resistance, and the next bit of evidence broke the spell for the other
      girls with a realization of what had taken place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The "ghost" wavered and seemed about to topple over, at the same time
      emitting a groan of pain which proved him to be thoroughly human. Helen
      was frightened, but there was a new kind of awe in this fright. All
      suggestion of superstition had left her and in its <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_143">143</span>place was the dread that she might have killed a
      man.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter dread, however, was soon dispelled. The "ghost" did not fall.
      He staggered, it is true-evidently the pain of the blow had stunned him
      considerably; but he managed to put speed into his pace, although the
      evidence of his suffering was even greater after he began to run. In a
      minute he disappeared in the darkness of the timber.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My! that was a good shot, Helen," Ethel Zimmerman exclaimed. "And he will
      surely wear some lump on his head for some time to come."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I was afraid I pulled too hard," Helen replied with a sigh of relief;
      "and, believe me, I'd rather be scared by a ghost several times over than
      with the prospect of having a murder record."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Who is he?-have you any idea?" Violet asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can't you guess?" Helen answered. "Isn't he someone connected with the
      Graham family?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What was he trying to do-scare us?" Julietta inquired, addressing the
      question as much to herself as to anybody else.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I should imagine something of the kind, although he may be the crazy man
      the Graham girls spoke about," said Helen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't believe there is any such person," Miss Ladd volunteered at this
      point.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>"Then why did they suggest
      such an idea?" Violet questioned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I don't know, unless it was to frighten us," the Guardian replied.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Frighten us away from here," Harriet supplemented.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Exactly," said Helen. "That's my theory of the affair. Don't you remember
      what Glen Irving said just before Addie Graham put in her appearance and
      cut short our interview with the boy?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He said something about ghosts," Harriet recalled.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not about ghosts, but <i>a</i> ghost," Helen corrected. "It made quite an
      impression on me. Didn't any of you wonder what he meant?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I did," announced Violet; "and I remember exactly what he said. It was
      this: 'I don't want them to scare you with a ghost.'"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Those were the very words," Helen declared. "Now do you get the
      connection between that remark and what just took place? Glen had heard
      them talking over their plans. Isn't it all very clear?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "At least it is very interesting," commented Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Since you have got so near a solution of this affair, perhaps you'll go a
      step farther and tell your interested audience who that ghost was," Ruth
      Hazelton suggested.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, no, I wouldn't be so rash as that," Helen responded; "but if I were
      going to write to Mrs. Hutchins tonight, I would suggest to <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>her that, if Mr. Pierce Langford
      should return to Fairberry in the next week or two, she might have
      somebody examine his head for a bump."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "A phrenological bump?" inquired Harriet, the "walking dictionary."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a general laugh.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Not a phrenological bump," Helen answered.

        CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A CRUEL WOMAN.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Katherine, Hazel, Ernestine and Azalia found it no easy task to pick their
      way through the dark timber more than half a mile to the Graham cottage.
      Several times, finding themselves hopelessly entangled in a thicket, or
      stumbling over disagreeably uneven ground, and fearful of losing their
      way, they made use of their flash lights until able to continue their
      journey satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But after they caught their first glimpse of the light in the Graham
      cottage, they made no further use of the flash lights. Guided by the
      illuminated windows and their memory of the surroundings, they made their
      way over the intervening space until within a hundred feet of the house,
      where they halted and looked and listened for about fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      First, they wished to make sure that there was no dog on the place. They
      were reasonably certain that the Grahams kept no watchdog, as several of
      the girls had been careful to check up in this regard when passing near or
      calling at the cottage. But as additional precaution, they made a careful
      inspection from a safe distance on this scouting expedition before
      venturing close to the house.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The night was clear and warm, but no moon was shining. There was a
      stillness in the air <span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>which
      alone might have been expected to cause a dog to howl for very
      lonesomeness. Even while the four scouts were waiting for evidence of a
      canine guard at the Graham place, far away in the distance there came a
      mournful howl from a mournful hound in a farmyard. The sound was repeated
      several times, and although there were two or three echoing responses from
      as many neighboring sources, none came from a kinship kennel of the Graham
      premises.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At last Katherine and Hazel decided that it was safe to advance nearer to
      the house. Leaving Azalia and Ernestine at the edge of the timber to watch
      for any condition or circumstance that might prove unfriendly to their
      venture, the two leaders advanced across the clearing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As they neared the building, a sound, which they had not heard before
      reached their ears and drove from their minds all thought or fear of a
      watchdog. The sound was like the plaintive cry of a child and seemed to be
      muffled as if coming through two or three thick walls.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There were two windows on the side of the house nearest the advancing girl
      scouts. Through the drawn shade of one of these came the rays of
      incandescent bulbs which lighted the room. The other window was dark.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The advance of Katherine and Hazel was guided now by the seeming source of
      the muffled <span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>cry. As they
      started for the house, their initial impulse was to direct their steps
      toward the lighted window. But as they approached the building, almost
      unconsciously they veered gradually to the right until they found
      themselves standing close to the unlighted window at the rear.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Without a doubt the muffled sounds came from this part of the cottage. A
      whispered conversation between the girls resulted in the following
      procedure: Hazel stood guard at a distance of ten or fifteen feet while
      Katherine stood close to the window, almost pressing her ear against the
      glass in order the better to hear the sounds that interested them. For two
      or three minutes the listener continued in this attitude; then she went to
      where Hazel stood and the latter advanced to the window and did likewise.
      She also tried the sash to see if it was locked, succeeding in raising it
      slightly, so that the sounds within reached her ear more distinctly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Several minutes later both of these girls returned to the edge of the
      clearing and rejoined their two companions stationed there. A low-voiced
      consultation was held, at the close of which Hazel said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, all this means that we'll have to return to the cottage and stay
      there until we find out something more. Let's see what we can discover in
      the front of the house."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She and Katherine accordingly went back and directed their inspection as
      Hazel had <span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>suggested. The
      shade trees did not cover the lower pane to the full limit and they were
      able to look in and get a fairly good view of the room.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Graham and "Jimmie Junior" apparently were the only members of the
      family at home, if we may disregard as one of the family, little Glen, who
      undoubtedly was the author of the muffled sobs. Mrs. Graham was reading a
      fashion magazine and her son was playing solitaire at a card table.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Almost the first view acquainted the girls with the fact that the woman
      was much disconcerted over something, and it soon became evident that the
      cause of this nervousness was the sound of weeping that reached her
      through the closed door of an adjoining room. Presently she arose, with a
      hard look on her face and determined manner, and moved in the direction
      from which the offending noise came.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Katherine and Hazel did not take the additional precaution this time of
      alternating as watcher and guard. They stood together at the window, and
      as they saw Mrs. Graham open the door they moved quickly to the window
      next toward the rear. By the time they reached it, this room also was
      lighted.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Fortunately a similar condition existed here also with reference to the
      width of the window shade and they were able to get a fairly good view of
      this apartment. Mrs. Graham evidently was disposed to lose no time <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_150">150</span>and to leave ground for no
      misunderstanding as to her purpose. She threw open a second door, this
      time a closet door, and the girls beheld a sight that fairly made their
      blood boil.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There sat little Glen on a chair with a rope wound around his body, arms,
      and legs, securing him so firmly to the article of furniture on which he
      was seated that he could scarcely move a muscle. His face was wet with
      tears and a picture of suffering.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      For the first time the watchers observed that the woman had a leather
      strap in her hand, and they were still further horrified when they saw her
      swing it cruelly against the bare legs of the quivering child.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Once, twice she struck the boy. Hazel and Katherine could hardly contain
      their indignation. Indeed it is not at all to be doubted that they would
      have attempted to interfere on the spot if an interruption had not come
      from another source before the third blow could fall.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a disturbance in the front of the house. Somebody had entered
      and was talking in a loud voice. Mrs. Graham let her arm fall without
      dealing the third blow for which she had raised it as a man entered the
      room in anything but mild and pleasant manner.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What are you doing, Mrs. Graham?" he demanded. "What did I tell you about
      this conduct of yours? Do you realize that you are bringing things to a
      climax where I'll wash my hands of the whole affair?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The speaker was Pierce Langford.
    </p>

        CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br /><span class="c002">THE GIRLS WIN.</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Mrs. Graham looked uncomfortable-not ashamed or abashed. Doubtless the
      conflict within her was between the cruelty of her nature and the fear of
      financial reverses in consequence of that cruelty. She did not answer the
      rebuke of her confederate attorney.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The latter drew a knife from his pocket and in a moment was severing the
      rope that bound the child to the chair. After he had released the boy, who
      looked gratefully toward him as a protector, the man threw cold water on
      little Glen's natural feeling of confidence toward him by saying:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Now, mind you, Mrs. Graham, my interference is not moved by any sentiment
      of sympathy for the kid. I merely want to inform you that things are
      coming to such a pass that I may be forced to drop out of this game purely
      as a move of self-salvation. For instance, it appears very unwise to make
      any further attempts to frighten that bunch of girls. They simply don't
      scare. See that?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Langford indicated the object of his question by taking off his hat, which
      he had neglected to remove when he entered the house, and caressing gently
      with two or three fingers a badly swollen wound on the side of his head
      almost directly over his right ear. Mrs. <span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>Graham
      looked at it curiously, not sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Where did you get that?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Those girls did it, or one of them, I presume. I thought my make-up would
      paralyze them, but instead they nearly paralyzed me. I think they fired
      some rocks at me, for something of that description struck my head, and
      you see the result.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I drove my machine into the timber a little farther up the road and put
      on my ghost outfit. Then I walked through the woods to the girls' camp and
      stalked past them. You would have thought my appearance was enough to
      freeze their veins and arteries. Well, they pretty nearly put mine in cold
      storage for eternity. Now, what do you know about 'first aid to the
      injured?' Will you get some cold water and alcohol or liniment? I'm going
      to have a fierce swelling. I don't suppose I can keep it down much now,
      but I'm going to have an awful headache and I'd like to prevent that as
      much as possible. Let the kid go to bed, and do something for me."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Glen took advantage of this suggestion and went into another room. Mrs.
      Graham and the lawyer returned to the living room. Katherine and Hazel
      watched them for about twenty minutes, but heard little more conversation.
      Then Langford left the house and Mrs. Graham and her son prepared to
      retire. As it appeared that they would be able to get no further
      information of interest to them <span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span>at
      the Graham cottage that night, Katherine and Hazel and the other two girls
      who waited at the edge of the clearing returned to their camp and reported
      the success of their expedition.
    </p>
    <hr class="c016" />
    <p class="c014">
      Early next day, Miss Ladd, Katherine, and Hazel went by boat to Twin Lakes
      and appeared before a magistrate and swore out a warrant for the arrest of
      Mrs. Graham on a charge of cruel and inhuman treatment of a child in her
      custody. Before leaving Fairberry she had been given authority to take
      this move if in her judgment such emergency action were advisable. She
      also asked that Glen Irving be removed from the custody of the Grahams.
      Then Miss Ladd sent a telegram to Mrs. Hutchins asking her to "come at
      once."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Hutchins arrived at Twin Lakes next day. Meanwhile Mrs. Graham was
      arrested and the boy was taken temporarily as a ward of the court. When
      she was confronted with the charges against her and the evidence of the
      two Camp Fire Girls who had witnessed one instance of outrageous cruelty,
      her cold resistance was broken and she promised to accede to Mrs. Hutchins
      demands if the prosecution were dropped.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This seemed to be the best settlement of the whole affair, and it was
      accepted. By order of court Glen was turned over to Mrs. Hutchins <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>who assumed the obligation of his
      care and custody.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Mrs. Hutchins remained with the girls a week at their camp at Stony Point,
      and then all returned to Fairberry, where the tents were pitched again in
      the broad and scenic ravine known as Fern Hollow. Here they camped again
      for another week, summarized, tabulated, and classified the achievements
      of the last few weeks, conferred honors, and finally adjourned to their
      several homes, there to remain until the autumn opening of school.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But the adventures of the year for this Camp Fire were not complete. More
      of equally stirring character were in store for three of the girls, and
      those who would follow these events should read the volume entitled:

      Now, will my readers be good enough to turn to their map of the United
      States and look at the state of Virginia, one of the most important
      members of the Union? You will notice the large inlet called Chesapeake
      Bay, which reaches far to the northward and divides Maryland into two
      sections, known as the Eastern and the Western shore. Down near the mouth
      of this bay you will observe the broad outlet of a large river, the James,
      named from James I., who succeeded Queen Elizabeth in 1603, and ruled
      England until his death in 1625. Make a careful study of the lower fifty
      or hundred miles of the James River, for the incidents I am about to tell
      you occurred in that section of the country.

    <p class="c014">
      At the time I have in mind-the beginning of 1607-there was not a white man
      in Virginia, nor in any of the present States to the northward. The
      Spanish had gained a foothold farther to the south, and St. <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>Augustine, Florida, the first
      permanent white settlement in the United States, had had a feeble
      existence for more than forty years. Of course, the mountains, lakes, and
      rivers were the same as they are today; but there were no cities, towns,
      or villages, only vast stretches of forest and wilderness, where roamed
      wild animals and wild men or Indians. These people had no horses or
      cattle. The large herds of wild horses which had already begun to roam
      over the prairies and plains of the southwest, were the descendants of the
      droves of the early Spanish explorers, but not an animal of that kind was
      to be found in Virginia or to the northward.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the Indians wished to go from one place to another, they did so by
      means of their canoes, or small birchen boats, if a stream was near; if
      not, they tramped through the forest. They knew nothing of firearms, but
      used bows and arrows, spears, tomahawks, and knives, with which they
      killed bears, deer, buffaloes, and large game. Since they did not know how
      to forge iron, they made their knives, tomahawks, and spearheads of bone
      or stone. These wild men were divided into large tribes or families, whose
      head or ruler was called <i>chief</i>, and whom all the others had to
      obey. His men were called warriors, the women were squaws, and the babies
      were papooses. The tribes <span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>were
      jealous of one another, and often fought. Generally their captives were
      put to cruel deaths. Some of the tribes numbered several thousand
      warriors, and in more than one instance a number of tribes formed a
      confederacy. The Iroquois, or Six Nations, whose headquarters were in the
      present State of New York, was the most powerful union of this kind that
      ever existed among the American Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Although, as I have said there was not an English settlement in America at
      the opening of 1607, you must not think no attempts had been made to form
      such colonies. Away up in New England parties of men had landed and tried
      to makes homes for themselves, but the climate was so rugged, and the
      hardships they had to face so trying, that they gave up, and those who did
      not die made haste to get back to Old England again.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The strangest fate of all attended the efforts of Sir Walter Raleigh to
      plant settlements in America. He sent out several expeditions, the last in
      1587. It numbered one hundred and fifty men and women, who, landing on
      Roanoke Island, off the coast of North Carolina, began building new homes.
      There the first child of English parentage was born, her name being
      Virginia Dare. I am sorry to say these people did not get on well
      together, but seemed to be quarrelling <span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>all
      the time. Finally, Governor White, who was the head of the colony, sailed
      for England to bring back help.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When he arrived home a war with Spain was threatened, and he was unable to
      return to Roanoke until after three years. He was very anxious to rejoin
      the people, for he had left his daughter among the colonists; but, strange
      to say, when he landed he was unable to find a single member of the
      company. He came upon many signs, but not a living man or woman. Sir
      Walter Raleigh did everything he could to learn their fate, but was never
      able to gain any certain knowledge. Today one of the strangest and most
      romantic incidents in the colonial history of the United States is that of
      the "Lost Colony of Roanoke." The mystery has never been explained how so
      many men and women could disappear and leave no trace behind them. But
      here is a theory which has always seemed reasonable to me:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Among the Indians of that section you will find at the present time quite
      a number who have light hair and blue eyes. What more probable than that
      the surviving members of the Lost Colony married among the natives, and
      that the odd-looking Indians of whom I have spoken are their descendants?
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It seems remarkable that more than a hundred years had passed since the
      discovery <span class="pageno" id="Page_162">162</span>of America by
      Christopher Columbus, without seeing the planting of a single permanent
      English colony on this side of the Atlantic. All this time, too, England
      laid claim to the whole continent, because of the discoveries of John
      Cabot and his son Sebastian. Finally, however, in 1606, two great
      companies were formed for the colonization of America, one in Plymouth and
      the other in London. The efforts of the Plymouth Company ended in failure,
      but the other corporation was successful. In the depth of the winter of
      1606, three vessels-the <i>Sarah Constant</i>, of one hundred tons burden;
      the <i>Godspeed</i> and the <i>Discovery</i>, each of forty tons, started
      across the Atlantic, under the command of Captain Christopher Newport.
      They carried one hundred and five men, but no women, and intended to
      settle at Roanoke Island, where the "lost colony" had disappeared some
      twenty years before; but they were driven farther north by a storm, and,
      with no idea of where they were, began hunting for a suitable place for
      settlement. They sailed into the broad opening of Chesapeake Bay, and were
      still roving northward when they were pleased with the appearance of a
      wide river, which flowed into the bay from the mainland on the west. They
      turned the prows of their little vessels <span class="pageno" id="Page_163">163</span>into
      this stream, carefully studying the shores in their quest for an inviting
      spot.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was the radiant month of May, with mild skies and soft breezes, which
      kept the craft steadily making their way against the gentle current. These
      hardy men, standing on the decks of their little vessels, and gazing at
      the shores, after being tossed about for months on the stormy Atlantic,
      were sure they had never gazed upon anything so beautiful. The banks were
      exuberant with brilliant wild flowers, whose sweet fragrance was wafted
      across the smooth waters, while the green hills and mountains in the
      distance were softened to the most delicate tints against the blue sky.
      The craft moved so slowly that the calm current made only the faintest
      rippling against the bows, and the bellying sails being once set, remained
      as smooth and unruffled as if they were so much painted canvas. All the
      attention needed was for the man at the helm to hold it steady, so as to
      keep the boat near the middle of the great stream.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Rich, emerald vegetation and gorgeous flowers were not all that caught the
      attention of the charmed Englishmen. There were men and women in this new
      country, descendants of those who had lived there for unknown ages. They
      were standing motionless on the shores, studying the approaching <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>vessels with much the same emotions
      that must have come to the natives of San Salvador when they first caught
      sight of the caravels of Columbus. One party, among whom several women
      could be seen, stood on a slight eminence, a hundred or more yards back
      from the stream, as if afraid to come any nearer. The warrior in the
      middle was fully a head taller than his companions, and was observed to
      point one hand towards the vessels, as if calling the attention of the
      others to some peculiar features of the strange craft, the like of which
      none had ever looked upon before.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On the margin of the river, where there was a natural clearing of an acre
      or so, another party gathered, including also several women. They were
      talking and gesticulating, and it would be interesting could we know what
      they said to one another. When the <i>Sarah Constant</i>, which was
      leading, and a hundred yards in advance of the smaller boats, came
      opposite this group, two of the warriors were seen to fit arrows to their
      bowstrings, aim carefully, and let them fly. The feathered missiles could
      be easily traced as they curved upward in a beautiful parabola, and then
      darted, head downward, into the clear current, not having traversed half
      the distance between the land and the ship. The men crowding the decks
      could well <span class="pageno" id="Page_165">165</span>afford to smile at
      such efforts. Captain Newport suggested that it would be a good thing to
      fire a volley into the party, as they had done some days before near the
      mouth of the river when greeted by a shower of arrows.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No; we should cultivate their good will; we shall have need of their
      friendship, and must not use our firearms so long as our lives can be
      saved without doing so."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This remark, in crisp, decisive tones, was made by a man standing at the
      prow, with a spy-glass in his hand, which he turned now and then towards
      the different groups. He was of sturdy build, dressed in the civilian
      dress of the well-to-do citizen of those times, with a full, sandy beard
      and a huge military mustache. His face was deeply tanned, he wore a sword
      at his side, and his countenance showed resolution and firmness. He was
      not yet thirty years of age, and no one could look at his figure without
      seeing he possessed unusual strength and hardihood. It was plain that
      mentally and physically he was above the officers and crew about him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This man was one of the most remarkable persons connected with the early
      history of the United States, and the foremost individual in the colonial
      period of the chief State. He was Captain John Smith, whose great services
      won him the name of the <span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>"Father
      of Virginia," and there can be no question that he deserved the honor.
      That he was a great boaster cannot be denied. Some of the stories he told
      of his adventures in France, Egypt, Hungary, Turkey, and other countries
      were true only in his imagination, recent researches having proved this to
      be the fact. None the less, he was one of the bravest of men, unselfish,
      enterprising, frank, and far-seeing; and it may as well be said at this
      point, that the first English colony in America would have perished from
      the earth but for the wisdom, energy, and self-sacrificing labors of this
      famous native of Lincolnshire.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Indians who had launched the useless arrows must have done so as an
      indication of their feelings towards the white men who had dared to invade
      their country. Now and then several of the warriors, bolder than their
      companions, skirted the shore in their canoes, keeping abreast of the
      vessels, and occasionally venturing for a little way towards them; but
      they hurriedly withdrew again, as if they had heard something of the
      terrible weapons which spouted fire and killed without anyone
      understanding how, since no eye could ever detect the fatal missile. The
      Indians in their boats, as a rule, kept close to land, so as to be ready
      to <span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>take to flight the instant
      it became necessary. The result more than once was amusing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A canoe containing four warriors, after several timid ventures, headed out
      in the river, as if they intended to board the strange craft. They paddled
      slower and slower, until when twenty rods or so from land their courage
      oozed away, and they dared advance no farther. They paused with their long
      ashen paddles still, ready to dip them into the current at the first sign
      of danger.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Without any command, the man at the helm pushed the rudder around, so that
      the bow of the largest ship slowly swung about, and it headed towards the
      canoe. The moment the occupants of the latter saw the fearful thing
      bearing down upon them they bent to their work with desperate energy, the
      craft skimming over the surface like a swallow. Captain Smith, smiling
      grimly, made a tunnel of one hand, and emitted a roar like that of an
      angry bull. The noise rolled over the smooth surface with terrifying
      power. Two of the Indians, in a wild panic, leaped overboard, and dived
      and swam in a frenzy of panic, while the others outsped them in the
      headlong haste of their paddling. Then as the panting fellows scrambled
      out on land, the <i>Constant</i> began laboriously swinging about again,
      and continued her course steadily up stream, most of the men <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>on board who had witnessed the
      incident breaking into laughter, which had a strange sound at that time
      and in that place.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The three vessels had begun their voyage up the James the previous day, so
      that now, while it was early in the afternoon, they were fully two score
      mile from the mouth of the noble river.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      They were approaching the peninsula where they were to make their final
      pause, when the attention of all was turned up stream. Captain Smith, in
      his interest brought his old-fashioned glass to his eye, and scanned the
      object that had suddenly taken on such interest for all. Around a sweeping
      bend in the broad river a single canoe shot into sight. The strange fact
      about it was that the two persons in it who must have discovered the ships
      the moment they came into their field of vision, did not turn to the right
      or left, but came straight on, as if heading for the largest boat, which
      kept in advance of its companions.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Only one of the Indians was swaying his paddle. He dipped the blade first
      on one side and then on the other, and the sparkling of the water was
      plainly seen in the bright sunlight, as the graceful craft remained in the
      middle of the current.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Newport, who also has a glass, came to within a few paces of where
      Smith <span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>was standing, closely
      studying the object. Although he was jealous of the plain spoken Smith,
      and had been, indeed, a party to his arrest on an absurd charge, he used a
      certain friendliness of manner which did not deceive the bluff fellow.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Those two warriors have more courage than their friend," remarked
      Newport.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "There is only <i>one</i> warrior in the canoe," replied Smith, still
      keeping the telescope to his eye; "the other is a woman, and--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      He hesitated as if waiting to feel sure before saying anything further.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When Newport had spent another minute or two in studying the boat he said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You are right, and the woman is not an old one."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "She is not a woman, but a girl."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Probably the daughter of the warrior."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That cannot be, for he is not much more than a boy-at most, he is only a
      young man."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "As young as <i>you</i>?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was sarcasm in the question, and it was marked by a grin, which
      Smith did not see.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He is younger in years than I, but not so young in wisdom as Captain
      Newport."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This remark was natural to Captain Smith, who had little respect for those
      in authority when they deserved none. Moreover, <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_170">170</span>the words were spoken in such loud tones that
      twenty others heard them, and, while they wondered at the boldness of
      Smith, they admired him the more. Still further, their feeling were the
      same as his, for Christopher Newport was much less a man in the true
      meaning of the word than John Smith.

        CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />BROTHER AND SISTER
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Captain John Smith was right as to the persons in the canoe which was
      coming down the James River and heading for the <i>Sarah Constant</i>.
      Seated a little in front of the middle of the craft, swinging the paddle,
      first on one side and then on the other, was a pleasing-looking Indian
      youth, who certainly was not twenty years of age. While propelling the
      boat he faced the vessels down the river. He had the usual long, coarse
      black hair of his people, which dangled about his shoulders, and his face
      was stained with the juice of the <i>puccoon</i>, or blood root. His chest
      was bare, but his waist was clasped with a girdle of deerskin, a shirt
      falling below to his knees, while leggings reached to his neat fitting
      moccasins, which were ornamented with beads. He was finely formed and must
      have been fleet of foot and a fine warrior, despite his few years.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The most interesting one in the canoe, however, was the sister of this
      youth. She was not more than a dozen years old, and showed a regularity of
      feature and beauty of countenance rarely seen among her race. <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>You will often hear Indian men and
      women spoken of as very handsome, but, in truth, there are very few worthy
      of the compliment. I have traveled among many tribes, and seen hundreds of
      the leading warriors and young women, and among them all were not ten who
      could be truly called attractive. I refer to their countenances, for their
      grace of form and movement is striking. But the high cheek-bones give
      their faces a lumpy appearance, their mouths are generally broad, and the
      features irregular. Now and then, however, we meet one whose beauty is
      striking because of its contrast with those around. Such was the fact in
      the present case.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The best that could be said of the young man was that he was pleasing in
      appearance. He had fine black eyes-as have all his race of pure
      blood-regular, even teeth, and an expression of brightness and good
      nature, but he could not compare with his young sister. Her features were
      of almost classical beauty, and had she been a Caucasian she would have
      been admired among any people.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Moreover, her dress was different from any that had caught the eyes of the
      observant Englishmen. Sitting at the bow, with enough space between her
      and her brother for their two long bows and quivers of arrows, she had
      thrown back her outer clothing, <span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>which
      was a robe of doeskin, lined with down from the breast of the wood-pigeon.
      She wore coral bracelets on her wrists and ankles, and a white plume in
      her abundant hair.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Her skirt and leggings were similar to her brother's, but the upper part
      of her body was clothed in a close-fitting jacket of doeskin, which
      covered her pretty, plump arms to the elbow. The comeliness of her face
      was not marred by the crimson juice that her brother used, and which was a
      favorite with most of her sex. This girl, who was growing fast, was a
      natural athlete, who could speed like a deer through the woods, launch an
      arrow with the accuracy of a veteran warrior, swim with the grace and
      swiftness of a fish, and read the faint signs of the woods as we read the
      pages of a printed book.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      By and by I shall mention the name of this famous miss; until then I shall
      let you see whether you can guess it. I am sure every one of you has heard
      it many times in the course of your reading of the history of my country.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas, as the young man was named, and his favorite sister had left
      their home a long way up the river, meaning to paddle down stream, and
      probably call upon some of their friends, when, in rounding a bend in the
      stream, they were startled by the sight of the three vessels, slowly
      coming up <span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>the river with
      their white sails spread, and their decks crowded by strangely-dressed
      men, studying the shores between which they were gliding in their immense
      "canoes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The sight, as well may be supposed, filled the two with amazement.
      Nantaquas stopped paddling for a minute or two, while both gazed at the
      sight. To them, in their forest home on the banks of the James, had come
      vague rumors of a people who lived far beyond the Great Water, whose skins
      were of a much lighter color than their own, and whose canoes were like
      giant birds, which were able to sail in safety when the storms drove the
      craft of the red men to shelter. Runners from the tribes to the far south
      had brought most of these stories. It is on record that Captain John Smith
      once met a party of Iroquois who were exploring this region. In their
      distant homes in Central New York they had heard the same strange accounts
      of white men and their ships, and the Iroquois brought the tidings to the
      tribes in Virginia.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      So, as I have said, when Nantaquas and his sister saw the three vessels
      coming up the James River they had a fair idea of their nature, and of the
      meaning of this visit to the region which never before had known the tread
      of the pale-faced race. The girl was lively, curious, and full of faith
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>in human nature-far more so
      than most of her people.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When she had looked for several minutes in silent amazement at the craft,
      and noted the forms of men on the decks, she said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why are they coming to the country of Powhatan?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I know not," replied her brother, resuming the sway of his paddle, but
      more gently than before, and turning his head as he spoke, that she might
      hear him more plainly; "it may be they mean to take away our hunting
      grounds."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other laughed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How can that be, when the warriors of Powhatan are like the leaves on the
      trees, and they are eager to do his will? There is but a handful of the
      pale-faces; surely we have nothing to fear from them; Nantaquas, let us
      visit the big canoes."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The proposal struck the youth so favorably that he increased the speed of
      his craft, and, as has already been shown, drew rapidly near the <i>Sarah
      Constant</i>, whose passengers and crew watched the approach of the
      graceful birchen structure with keen curiosity. As Nantaquas sped down
      stream, however, he was thinking hard, and he began to ask himself
      questions, which showed a doubt of the wisdom of carrying out the wishes
      of his sister. He believed that any people <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_176">176</span>who were treated kindly, and in whom confidence
      was shown, would give the same treatment to those that were good to them.
      She would not have feared to climb the side of the big canoe and welcome
      the white men. She knew they had much greater knowledge than her own
      people; and, though she and her brother had no food or presents to offer
      the visitors, they could show their friendship towards them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But Nantaquas was wise beyond his years. He recalled that the stories
      which he had heard of the white men were not to their credit. Some of them
      had slain Indians as though they were wild animals; they had treated them
      with great cruelty, and repaid kindness with brutality. The reason that
      such reports came to Nantaquas was that they were brought by visitors from
      the south, where the Spanish had made settlements. The story of their
      colonization of the United States and Mexico was stained by many dreadful
      crimes, which might well make the youth hesitate to trust himself or his
      sister in their power. They were likely, he thought, to carry one or both
      off as prisoners or demand a large price for their ransom. So it was, that
      as Nantaquas drew near the <i>Sarah Constant</i>, he gradually slackened
      his speed, until he finally held his paddle motionless, <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>and allowed the canoe to come to
      rest with much space still between the two crafts.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      By this time everyone on the three vessels was intently watching the
      little canoe and its occupants. Sails were still hoisted, and the vessels
      kept moving slowly up stream, the tide being at its turn. On either shore
      were gathered staring groups of Indians, men, women, and even children,
      whose emotions were as stirring as those of the white men on the larger
      craft. The face of the pretty young girl in the canoe glowed, for never
      had she gazed upon so wonderful a picture. Scores of men in their peaked
      hats, several of which were adorned with flowing plumes, their short coats
      clasped about the waist with broad girdles, with a huge buckle in front,
      the short breeches ending at the knees, with the heavy stockings below,
      and, more than all, the tanned countenances, some of which were covered
      with shaggy beards, made up a picture that might well hold the two
      wondering spectators almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas checked his boat when a hundred yards from the largest vessel.
      Inasmuch as that kept moving, he dallied with his paddle just enough to
      hold his graceful craft abreast. Captain John Smith, the famous navigator,
      Bartholomew Gosnold, Wingfield, Newport, Ratcliffe, Martin and Kendall-all
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>of whom had been named as
      Councillors by King James-were at the rail of the <i>Sarah Constant</i>,
      looking off and down at the visitors, who, although they had come so
      close, hesitated to draw nearer to the vessel.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith called in his bass, resonant welcome:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Welcome! Welcome! Will you not come that we may shake hands with you and
      break bread together?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Of course, not a word of this was understood by Nantaquas and his sister,
      but the beckoning gestures of more than one man formed a language whose
      meaning was plain. The girl asked her brother impatiently:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why do you hesitate? They wish to greet us; you are ungrateful."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was decision in the tones of the youth: "They are strangers; we have
      heard evil things of many of them; we shall go no nearer."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She knew it was useless to argue with him when he was in such a mood. She
      pouted, but said no more. Since the gestures gave a clue to the meaning of
      the words of invitation, Nantaquas raised one hand, palm outward, and
      waved it towards the ship. He meant it as a courteous refusal to accept
      the invitation, and, that there might be no mistake as to his meaning, he
      suddenly dipped his paddle deep in the water, and <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_179">179</span>sent the canoe skimming up stream. His companion
      continued in displeased silence, and the men on the ship repeated their
      gestures of welcome, though they knew they would remain unheeded.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Only one of the Englishmen noticed a peculiar thing at this moment.
      Nothing seemed to escape the keen eyes of Captain Smith. Shifting his
      glance from the little boat speeding up stream, he looked to the left, or
      south. The shore was a long distance away, for the river is very wide at
      this point, and he saw a thin column of smoke filtering upwards from among
      the trees on a wooded elevation, a little way inland. It was not an
      ordinary column of vapor, such as burning brushwood makes, but it had a
      wavy motion from side to side. The same clear vision which noted this,
      noted also that the column of smoke was broken so as to show two distinct
      gaps between the base and the top, where it melted into the clear
      atmosphere against the blue sky beyond.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There could be no question that a signal fire had been kindled on the
      slight elevation, and that the peculiar look of the vapor was a message
      sent by someone to someone else, who, probably, was far in the depths of
      the wilderness. Who should read its meaning? No white man certainly,
      though <span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>he for whose eyes it
      was meant would have no trouble in understanding it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith glanced from face to face around him, and saw that none had
      noticed the proceedings. He said nothing, for no one could instruct him;
      but the shrewd fellow was certain in his own mind that, whatever the
      message might be, it had to do with the white men who were sailing up the
      great river, hunting for a spot upon which to find the first real
      settlement in the New World.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas plied the paddle like one who could never tire. He had been
      trained in the ways of the woods from the time he was able to walk. He had
      come a long distance down stream on this glowing day in May, and the
      exercise of propelling the canoe might be kept up for hours without
      weariness on his part. The same may be said of his companion, for she had
      proved it many a time, and would have proved it in the present instance,
      had her brother permitted; but he showed no such wish, and, after passing
      above the bend which shut the strange picture from sight, he kept up the
      same machine-like swaying of the arms, until they had traversed a goodly
      number of miles, and the beauteous spring afternoon was drawing to a
      close.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And, throughout this long interval, neither he nor his sister spoke. She
      was displeased <span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>because of his
      refusal to take her aboard the big canoe, and, though she loved him too
      dearly to feel anything in the nature of real anger, she meant he should
      know that, in her opinion, he had acted the churl. He understood her
      feeling, and wisely gave her time to rally from it. Indian though he was,
      he shared with her a certain waggish disposition which often showed
      itself. He did several things that may seem strange in one of his race.
      The bow and stern of the canoe were similar, so that it could go in one
      direction as well as the other. He was seated just beyond the middle,
      facing the course it was following, while the girl, having gathered her
      robe about her shoulders as the chill of the coming evening made itself
      felt, was at the stern. As she looked at her brother she saw his back, and
      noted the action of the coppery arms as they swung the paddle with perfect
      skill.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She was gazing absently at the mass of black hair dangling about his
      shoulders, thinking, no doubt, how "horrid" he had been, when he abruptly
      paused, turned, looked straight into her face, and made a comical grimace.
      He did not speak, and immediately resumed his paddling. She pouted more
      than before, turned up her pretty nose, and stared to the left at the
      wooded shore. Ten or fifteen minutes later <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_182">182</span>he repeated his action, except that he continued
      grimacing and chuckling, as if determined to make her smile. She flushed
      and strove hard to keep her cross countenance, but could not. She laughed,
      in spite of herself, but, as he resumed paddling, she reached forward,
      caught hold of a strand of his hair, and pulled it, taking pains to jerk
      <i>upwards</i>, so as to make sure it hurt. It was a vigorous pull, but
      Nantaquas acted as if unaware that anything of the kind had taken place,
      and the girl, as if sorry for her petty outburst, sat back again and
      looked in a more kindly way at the big brother whom she loved so dearly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      None the less she was planning how she could punish him for his disregard
      of her wishes. By and by the sparkle of her black eyes told that she had
      hit upon a scheme. She was impatient for the moment to come, though, in
      the nature of things, it was already at hand.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Within the following half-hour Nantaquas turned the prow of the canoe
      towards the northern shore, gradually slackening his work as it sped to
      land. Just before touching the bank he made a long sweep with the paddle,
      which turned the craft around, and then reversed the propulsion, so as to
      land the girl first. Instead of stepping out before <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_183">183</span>her, he gave that honor, as was befitting to the
      imperious young woman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And as he did so the same young woman, with a thrill of pleasure, saw that
      her moment of revenge had come!
    </p>

    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The canoe had not yet touched the land, when the girl leaped out as
      lightly as a fawn, not pausing to pick up her bow and quiver, lying in the
      bottom of the boat beside those of her brother. Facing about, she grasped
      the front of the craft with both hands, as if to draw it up the bank
      beyond reach of the action of the tide.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Almost at the same moment Nantaquas laid his dripping paddle beside the
      implements, and rose partly to his feet, bending over to gather up the
      bows and arrows. In the act of doing so, and while his body was in a
      stooping posture, the girl gave a lightning-like, sideways jerk to the
      boat, snapping it forward like a flash, for a distance of fully two feet.
      The youth had no thought of anything of the kind, and yet, knowing his
      sister as well as he did, he <i>ought</i> to have been prepared. Thrown so
      suddenly off his balance, he went backward over the side of the canoe,
      which narrowly escaped upsetting; and, as his heels kicked in the air and
      he vainly threw out his arms to save himself, he dropped out of sight in
      water twenty feet deep.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>The girl screamed with
      delight. Her scheme had worked to perfection; she had punished her brother
      as she planned, and as he deserved. Down, down he went, before he could
      right himself and get his bearings. Then his head popped up, he blew the
      water from his mouth, and one or two powerful strokes brought him to land.
      Scrambling to his feet, he made for the laughing girl. He was not angry,
      for he admired her brightness, but-wait till he could lay hands on the
      mischievous sprite!
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But she was not yet caught. Brimming over with fun, she darted into the
      wood, with him in headlong pursuit. Perhaps on the open plain, in a
      straightaway chase, he might have overtaken her, though it is by no means
      certain; but she was quicker than he in dodging, turning, and doubling.
      With one hand outstretched, and seemingly about to grasp an arm or
      shoulder, his fingers closed on vacancy, as she whisked to one side, and,
      waiting until he repeated the attempt, she slipped again beyond reach.
      Like a civilized girl, she kept screaming and laughing while thus engaged,
      glancing continually over her shoulder, and baffling her pursuer at the
      very moment that success seemed certain.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All the time she was heading toward her home, not far off in the woods,
      while he, <span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>forgetful of the
      implements left behind in the canoe, kept up his efforts to lay hands on
      her. He would not believe he could fail, and she nurtured the
      self-delusion on his part, encouraging him once or twice by allowing the
      outstretched hand to touch her robe, though it could never grip it fairly.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Suddenly, just as he held his breath ready to leap forward and pounce upon
      her, and it looked as if nothing could save the fugitive, she did a very
      clever thing. She darted across a spot in the woods where the ground was
      covered with many running vines. She did this, but he was too earnest in
      the pursuit to notice danger. She led him on, and again his hand shot out
      almost over her shoulder, when he caught his moccasin in one of the vines,
      that was like so many yards of fine steel wire, and sprawled forward on
      his face, with a force that drove the breath from his body, and seemed to
      make the earth shake with the shock.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And then she could run no farther, from very excess of merriment. Pressing
      one hand against the nearest tree-trunk to support her, she laughed until
      she could hardly stand. He slowly climbed to his feet and shook his head.
      She was not assured that he had given up the chase, and held herself ready
      to bound away again, when both <span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>abruptly
      paused at the discovery that a third party had appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Two or three rods in advance, on the same line the two had been pursuing,
      stood a tall Indian, fully six feet in stature, motionless, and surveying
      the couple with an enquiring expression. He was three score years of age,
      his long locks were sprinkled with grey, and his face was stern and seamed
      by the passage of the many stormy years. He was thin almost to emaciation,
      but the fire burned in the black eyes as fiercely as when he first went on
      the warpath. He was dressed much like the younger warrior, except that the
      upper part of his body was encased in a jacket similar to that of the
      girl, and his countenance was unstained. In the girdle about his waist
      were thrust a long knife and the handle of a tomahawk, but he carried no
      bow and quiver. Standing rigidly upright, with his coppery face like that
      of a stone image, he looked sternly at the two.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hardly had the girl caught sight of him, when she ran forward, and,
      throwing both arms about his waist, called out in pretended panic:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Father, save me from Nantaquas! He means to kill me!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Laying one hand fondly on the wealth of hair about his chest, the parent
      gazed at the young man and demanded:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>"What is the meaning of these
      strange actions?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Standing in his garments, still wet from his recent upset, the smiling son
      pointed to his sister.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "She will tell Powhatan her story."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The American Indian has the reputation of being stoical. It is true that
      he will bear the most poignant anguish and torture without a sign of
      suffering. He is trained to suppress his emotions, especially before
      strangers, but there are no persons in the world who love their children
      more affectionately; and when beyond the sight of strangers they often
      indulge in expressions of that love.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The chieftain of whom I am now speaking was the most famous Indian
      connected with the colonial history of Virginia. He was Powhatan, one of
      the sternest and most unflinching leaders of his race. He ruled over
      numerous tribes, nearly all of whom he had conquered and brought under his
      sway. From Virginia to the far south none was his equal. He had several
      homes, at each of which he lived a part of every year, and was always
      surrounded when at any of them by a strong guard, numbering forty or fifty
      of his tallest warriors.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Since you have learned that Powhatan was the father of the two who now
      stood <span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>before him, there is no
      longer any excuse for keeping back the name of the girl, for I am sure you
      guessed it long ago. She was Pocahontas, pretty, bright, and kind hearted,
      and the favorite of the terrible Powhatan, who permitted any liberties
      from her, and rarely refused her a request which he could gratify.
      Nantaquas was another favorite, though he had other sons who were well
      worthy of their father's fame.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Releasing herself from the embrace of her parent, Pocahontas stepped back
      a couple of paces, and with sparkling eyes and glowing face told Powhatan
      about the incident that had sent her flying from before her brother. It
      would have done your heart good to see those iron features relax as the
      sachem listened to the delightful story. Although well advanced in years,
      and a stoic by training, he could not wholly forget the time when he was
      such a youth as that son who stood a little way back, with arms folded,
      listening to the words of his sister, and never offering objection.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Powhatan extended his arms, and as Pocahontas stepped impulsively forward,
      he placed a hand under each of her elbows, and tossed her like a feather
      several feet up in the air. As she came down he caught her in his grasp,
      held her closely to him, and fondled her hair and patted her dusky <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>cheek; while she, in turn, reached
      up and patted his wrinkled face. No father and child could have loved each
      other more truly than Powhatan and Pocahontas.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But the grim parent did not permit himself to indulge long in his caresses
      of the one so dear to him. Again patting her head, he said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let my child go to her home; Powhatan has something he would say to
      Nantaquas."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She obediently turned away. Her course carried her behind the sachem, who
      had withdrawn all attention from her. Pausing an instant, she looked at
      her brother, who was still standing with folded arms, and who turned to
      glance at her the moment she halted, curious to learn the cause. He was
      quickly informed, for standing thus, where no one else saw her, she made
      the same comical grimace at him that he made at her when paddling the
      canoe. He suddenly started towards her, but took only a step, when she was
      off like a bird. Powhatan turned his head, but caught only a glance of the
      handsome robe, the white plume, and the twinkling moccasins, as they
      flitted from sight.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      You will bear in mind that in giving the conversations between the various
      Indians who pass before us, I use the utmost liberality in translation. As
      a rule, their sentences <span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>are
      short, and often ornamented with striking figures of speech. They sound
      stiff, and are sometimes hard to understand by those not accustomed to
      them. It will be better, therefore, to try to put their meaning in the
      form which you use in your conversation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hardly had Pocahontas darted from sight, when the chieftain said to his
      son:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The pale-faces have come across the Deep Water to the hunting-grounds of
      Powhatan and his people."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes; we met them on the river in their big canoes; they spoke words,
      though we did not understand what they said, nor could they know the
      meaning of our words. They have come to make their homes among us."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The remark of the chieftain proved that the signal fire, of which mention
      has been made, was not only meant for him, but that he read the message.
      It seems strange that so much could be told by the fashioning of the thin
      column of smoke rising from a small fire kindled on the crest of a slight
      elevation; but such means of telegraphy have been used by the American
      Indians for centuries, and the speed with which they send tidings across
      wide stretches of country almost surpasses belief. It is only a few years
      since that an important treaty was signed by the United States Government
      agents with a number of tribes in the West. The parties were so <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>far removed from the nearest
      telegraph station that the news did not reach Washington until three days
      later; yet it was known to tribes four and five hundred miles distant the
      afternoon of the day of signing, and within a few hours after the
      signatures were written. The message was signalled from mountain peak to
      mountain peak, across wide stretches of prairie, and hundreds of warriors
      discussed the matter long before their chiefs set out for their distant
      homes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      So in the case of Powhatan, chief of many tribes, who knew of the coming
      of the white men while they were sailing up the James, and for several
      days before he saw any one of them. It is easy to understand how an
      ordinary message, relating to simple affairs, can be carried by the means
      named, but it is wonderful how news, unlike any that had ever before been
      sent across an expanse of forest, could have been read by the sachem and
      others for whom it was meant.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Powhatan left no doubt that he was deeply displeased by the appearance of
      the white men, where they had never before set foot. They had come into
      the heart of the country which belonged to him, and he was too wise to
      fail to see the meaning of the visit.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They will come to land, and build their wigwams; they will till the
      ground, and hunt the game in the woods; by and by others will <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>come and make their homes beside
      them; and they will keep on coming, till they are like the leaves on the
      trees; we have heard from the red men of the south that they bring strange
      weapons; that they shoot fire, and slay men who are far beyond the reach
      of our bows and arrows; all the pale-faces are alike; they will kill the
      red men or drive them into the sea, until none is left."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The words of Powhatan are wise," said Nantaquas respectfully; "I am
      afraid of them, and would not trust Pocahontas in their power."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "My son did right; she is but a child; she must stay away from them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And what shall be done with the pale-faces?" asked Nantaquas, who
      understood the dark expression of his father. "Shall they be left alone
      when they go ashore, that their numbers may increase-though I do not think
      they have any women with them?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "When the serpent is small, a child may crush it under the heel of her
      moccasin, but, if left to grow, it will soon sting her to death."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The meaning of these words was plain; Powhatan intended to destroy the
      weak colony before the white men could send for other friends to sail
      across the Great Water. Few even though they were, the work should be hard
      and dangerous, when so little was known of the real nature of their
      fearful weapons; <span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>but, no
      doubt, the thousands of warriors that Powhatan could summon to the task
      would do it well, thus crushing the danger in the bud.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Powhatan, like most of his race, was a man of few words. Having made known
      his resolve, he ordered his son to lead the way to where the canoe had
      been left on the bank of the stream. When it was reached he stepped
      within, and, instead of seating himself at the stern, took his place at
      the bow. It would have been sacrilege for Nantaquas to suggest that the
      chieftain who is referred to by historians as "Emperor" should use the
      paddle. No vassal could have been meeker than the son when he headed down
      the river, handling the oar with the same skill that he had shown earlier
      in the day.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      By this time the afternoon was drawing to a close, but there was a bright
      moon in the sky, which lit up the broad, smooth surface of the James as if
      it were day. The sachem sat silent and erect, with no appearance of
      curiosity, but the keen eyes, which pierced the gathering gloom, did not
      let the smallest object escape them. Passing around the long, sweeping
      bend that has been described, the large vessel and two smaller ones came
      into view, lying at anchor, within a short distance of shore. It might
      have been thought that the emigrants had come to rest, to wait till the
      morrow before going farther <span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>up
      stream, had not smaller boats been seen passing to and fro between the
      ships and the land. But more still was soon learned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Although from what Nantaquas and Pocahontas had told it would seem that
      little was to be feared at present from these unwelcome visitors, the life
      of Powhatan was too precious to permit any unnecessary risk to be run. He
      ordered his son to go a little nearer, holding himself ready to make
      instant flight when told to do so. Thus edging up, they were able to see
      three or four tents on a small peninsula, jutting out from the northern
      shore. The white men from across the sea had already landed and begun the
      first lasting English settlement in the New World.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas would have liked to visit the newcomers, now that his sister was
      not with him, but Powhatan would not allow it, and, at his command, he
      turned the head of the canoe up stream, before it had attracted notice,
      and paddled hurriedly from the place. As before, the chieftain did not
      speak, even after the boat had been run to land and drawn up the beach. He
      stepped out, and, with the majesty that was rarely or never absent, strode
      through the wilderness to his lodge or native "palace," with his son
      walking silently at the rear. Arrived there, he held a long council with
      his under chiefs and leading warriors. The plans for the destruction of
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>the colony were fixed; but
      before he slept that night Pocahontas drew from him all that had been
      agreed upon, and she did not rest until he had given his promise to defer
      the fearful work. He would not pledge himself to do more than postpone his
      purpose, but such postponement was of the greatest importance to the
      welfare of the little colony.

        CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">A CALL OF STATE</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      The three small ships with their one hundred and five men sailed up the
      James River, until they had reached a point some fifty miles from its
      mouth, when their interest was drawn to a low peninsula, which put out
      from the northern shore. It was a bad site for a settlement, because it
      was half covered with water at high tide. Since those days it has become
      an island; but it looked so pleasing to the men who had been tossed on the
      stormy ocean for so many months, that it was taken as their new home.
      Anchor was dropped, the smaller boats began taking the emigrants and their
      belongings to shore, and there, on May 13th, 1607, was founded Jamestown,
      which, as I have already stated, was the first lasting settlement planted
      by the English in the New World.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Sad to say, nearly three quarters of a century later, when the colony was
      torn by civil strife, Jamestown was burned to the ground, and never
      rebuilt. All that remains are the ruins of an old church tower and a few
      mouldering tombstones. These are rapidly crumbling; <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_198">198</span>the waves dash mournfully against the shore; the
      sea-fowl flit past; and ere many years come and go all traces of the
      famous town will have disappeared.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As the English went ashore they pitched their tents, but the season was so
      mild that they found it more agreeable to make their homes for the time
      under the verdant foliage of the trees while building their cabins. These
      were put up on the neck of the peninsula, and before long the place took
      on the appearance of a community. It is a pleasure to recall that these
      people were good churchmen, and from the hour of their landing gave strict
      attention to the duties of religion. The first place of public worship in
      America was a ragged tent. An awning was stretched among the trunks of
      trees, and a bar, fastened between two of these, served as a reading desk.
      At this Mr. Hunt read the Service morning and evening, preached twice each
      Sunday, and, at intervals of three months, celebrated the Holy Communion.
      When he was prevented through illness or other causes, Captain John Smith
      or some of his associates read the service.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As soon as the hurry of work was over, a structure was put up. Of course,
      it was of modest size and build, but when Lord Delaware arrived three
      years later, he records that this first religious edifice built by
      Englishmen <span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>in America was
      sixty feet long and twenty four feet wide.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It would seem that the best of beginnings had been made, for trees were
      felled, cabins built, and a church erected; but a woeful mistake lay in
      the character of the men themselves. Very few had the least fitness for
      pioneer work. When the box was opened in which King James had sealed the
      names of the first seven Councillors, all but two of those selected proved
      grossly unfit. These two were Bartholomew Gosnold and John Smith. Gosnold
      soon died, and Smith had not been freed from arrest on the charge of
      plotting against the colony. Edward Maria Wingfield was chosen first
      president, but he was lazy, self-indulgent, and seemed to be able to think
      of nothing except Smith and his plots for placing himself at the head of
      affairs. The other Councillors were no better than he, and the prospect of
      Jamestown was dark.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This sad unfitness was not confined to the rulers. More than half the men
      were ranked as "gentlemen," which in those times meant persons who did not
      do manual labor. The wild rumors of the abundance of gold in the New World
      drew them across the ocean. They believed that it would take only a short
      time to load the three vessels with the yellow metal, when they would
      return to England and live in luxury for the rest of their days. <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>You naturally find that most of
      those who toiled for a living were jewelers and gold-refiners.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Sturdy, rugged, honest John Smith saw all this with anger and disgust. He
      knew what was surely coming, and calmly waited for it to come. Although
      shut out from the Council, he did not sulk, though he felt the injustice.
      "By and by they will ask for me," he thought, as he went vigorously to
      work. He impressed upon his friends the necessity of keeping on good terms
      with the Indians. The season was far advanced, but corn was planted with
      the certainty that it would ripen fast in that favoring climate and soil.
      But the food brought over the ocean would not last more than two or three
      months, when it would be necessary to obtain supplies from the Indians. If
      they chose to withhold it, it would go ill with the white men.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Now if you will look at your map again, you will note the situation of
      Jamestown on the northern shore. Tracing the course of the James River
      towards its source, you will observe the city of Richmond, the capital of
      Virginia, on the same side of the river, but well up in Henrico county.
      Below the site of Richmond, in the direction of Jamestown, was the
      principal residence of Powhatan, chief of thirty tribes, his own immediate
      tribe being scattered inland and along the river to <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_201">201</span>the south and east. It was a two-day's journey
      between the village of Powhatan and Jamestown.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Distrustful of the old chief's temper towards them, Captain Smith and a
      party of his men took the first chance to sail up the river and pay a
      formal visit to the Emperor of the country. The name of the town itself
      was Powhatan, from which fact the same title has been given to the famous
      chieftain, whose Indian name was different. The aboriginal capital stood
      on a small hill, and numbered twelve houses, in front of which were three
      small islands in the river. The "palace" was a large, native structure of
      bark and skins, with a sort of bedstead at one side, on which Powhatan
      sat. With his majestic mien, his robe of raccoon skins, and the feathers
      in his grizzly hair, he suggested a king upon his throne.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When Smith and two of his companions were brought into the presence of
      this Emperor the scene was striking. Along each wall of the dwelling stood
      two rows of young women at the rear, and two rows of men in front of them.
      The faces and shoulders of all the females were stained with the red juice
      of the puccoon, and a number wore chains of white beads about their necks.
      Almost any man would have been embarrassed when introduced into the
      presence of royalty of this <span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>character.
      Smith's companions were mute, but he was too much a man of the world to
      betray any fear. He doffed his hat, made a sweeping bow, and addressed the
      old chieftain with as much outward respect as if he had been, indeed, the
      King of England.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      One of the most marked proofs of the ability of Captain John Smith was
      that during his brief stay in Virginia he had been able to pick up enough
      knowledge of the Powhatan tongue to make himself fairly well understood,
      being helped thereto by his gestures, of which he was master. There had
      been Indian visitors from the first at Jamestown. All were treated so well
      that several spent much of their time at the settlement, studying the
      white men and their ways with never-ending interest. Smith became a hard
      student, and was thus able to tell Powhatan that he and the other
      pale-faces had come across the Great Water with feelings only of love for
      him and his people. They had no wish to take away their hunting-grounds,
      not to kill their game, nor to do them harm in any way. He hinted that the
      whites might prove to be of great help to Powhatan, for they brought
      strange and deadly weapons with them, which they would be glad to use in
      aiding him to conquer other tribes of Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith was a man of rare tact, but he blundered when he made this
      offer to the <span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>old Emperor. It
      said, in truth, that Powhatan was not able to do his own conquering of
      rebellious tribes. Such was the power and self-confidence of this sachem,
      that any hint that he could need help in carrying out his own will was an
      insult to him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith was quick to see his mistake, and did what he could to correct it,
      but he did not succeed. Powhatan was sour, and nothing was clearer than
      that he felt no good will toward those who had dared to make their homes
      in his country. He pretended not to understand the broken sentences of his
      visitor, until after one of his warriors had helped to interpret them.
      Having met with no success, Smith and his friends withdrew and set sail
      down the river for Jamestown.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      During the interview both he and his companions used their eyes in
      searching for the youth and the girl who had met them when first on their
      way up the James. But neither Nantaquas nor Pocahontas was present, a fact
      which proved they were absent from the town, for, were it not so, nothing
      would have kept them from the "palace" on such and an interesting
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boat in which the Englishmen had sailed up the river had to lie by for
      one cloudy night while on the way, and now the explorers found themselves
      overtaken by darkness, when hardly half the return voyage was made. <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>But the sky was clear, and again
      they were favored with a bright moon, which so lit up the stream that they
      kept on their course, with the prospect of reaching home quite early the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      While one of the men held the old-fashioned tiller, with nothing to do but
      to keep the boat well away from shore, Smith sat at the bow, thoughtfully
      smoking a long-stemmed pipe which he had bought from one of the friendly
      Indians who often visited Jamestown. The others of his associates were
      doing the same at a little distance, for most of the English were quick to
      learn the habit from the red men. The night was so still that a single
      sail hardly felt the touch of the gentle breeze, and only now and then did
      the faint ripple at the bow show that the boat was making any progress
      toward Jamestown.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith had many things to vex and trouble him. He was angry when he
      thought of the injustice under which he suffered, and the worthlessness of
      those named to rule the colony. With the coming of the hot, sultry
      southern summer all prudence seemed to leave the settlers. They drank
      deeply of the unwholesome water, and the mists that brooded over the
      neighboring swamps were heavy with malaria, which had already laid a
      number on their backs, with more than one fatal issue threatened.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>Those who kept healthy
      thought it too uncomfortable to toil when the hot sun was overhead, and as
      twilight and night drew near, the day was too far gone to make it worth
      while to labour. They would not be roused early enough in the day to do
      anything of account, though most of them did make a pretense of hoeing the
      corn, of which several acres were growing. Wingfield, the president, set
      the example of indolence, and instead of being moderate in eating, acted
      as if there never could come an end to the food that had been brought
      across the sea, and which was already nearly exhausted. What the colony
      needed above everything else was a stern, rigorous, wise head, and it is
      no reproach to Captain Smith that he said to himself: "<i>I</i> am the
      only man for the time; but they have tied my hands, though they shall not
      be tied long."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      While the future looked so dark, he was more disturbed by the present, or
      what might be called the near future. He saw in the glum, resentful manner
      of Powhatan something more than displeasure with the presence of the white
      men. Holding such great power as did the chieftain, he was not likely to
      remain quiet much longer. He could not but know of the growing weakness of
      the colonists, who were short of food, with much sickness <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>among them, and the certainty that
      before long they would be at the mercy of the Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith wondered why an attack had not been made upon the settlement long
      before. With the vast body of warriors that Powhatan could summon at his
      will, they would have been able to crush the little band of white men,
      despite the dreaded firearms at their command. The pioneer had no idea
      that the postponement of such an assault was due to Pocahontas, nor did he
      learn the truth until years afterward.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      He looked at the dark, frowning shores on either hand, stretching in the
      distance many miles beyond the farthest extent of vision when the sun was
      shining, and thought of the thousands of warriors who roamed and hunted
      through those solitudes, fighting one another, when, had they been wise
      enough to unite their strength, they could bid defiance to any armed fleet
      that England might send across the ocean.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Suddenly a star-like gleam showed on the southern shore. That it had been
      kindled by the Indians was not to be doubted. Watching it for a minute or
      so, without seeing anything more than a glowing point, Smith turned his
      face toward the northern bank. At the moment of doing so he observed an
      answering signal, and was not surprised, for <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_207">207</span>it was natural that such a reply should be made.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They are speaking to one another about our boat, but that is of no
      concern to me, for I do not think we have anything to fear from them."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      He scanned the two shores in the expectation of seeing other signal fires,
      but none showed. Meanwhile the boat made little headway against the tide,
      for the gentle breeze hardly fanned one's face. Smith rose to his feet,
      and with pipe between his lips, gazed out on the moonlit expanse of river,
      not expecting to discover anything unusual, and yet something of that
      nature quickly appeared.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A peculiar flickering toward the northern shore caught his eye, and while
      trying to learn what it meant he saw that the object was an Indian canoe,
      in which he soon made out two persons, with the nearer one swaying a
      paddle, while his companion sat quietly at the stern.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain recalled the sight which greeted the ships when first coming
      up the James. There was the small craft, driven in the same manner, and
      with the same number of persons. Standing erect at the gunwale, he watched
      it closely, and a minute or two later was certain that the two were
      Nantaquas and Pocahontas. He had learned of <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_208">208</span>their identity from the friendly Indians who came
      to Jamestown, the plume worn by the girl being a badge of royalty.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The canoe was passing the bow of the ship, a hundred yards away, making no
      attempt to come nearer. Desiring a talk, Smith called in his resonant
      voice:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Nantaquas! Will you not come aboard?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The youth appeared to say a few words to his sister, after which he headed
      his craft in the direction of the larger one. A few minutes would have
      brought him alongside, when he was checked by a startling interruption.
      Through the stillness sounded a low booming sound, which rolled up the
      stream and was heard faintly to echo between the shores.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There could be no mistaking its meaning: it was the report of one of the
      small cannon on the <i>Sarah Constant</i>, and it meant danger to
      Jamestown.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Through the stillness of the summer night rolled the sound of the cannon
      that had been fired in front of Jamestown, many miles down the river. The
      report, which was not repeated, sent a thrill of alarm through Captain
      Smith and his friends, for to them it could have but one meaning: it had
      been discharged because of an attack upon the settlement by Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The boom, as it traveled up the broad stream, carried the same tidings to
      the son and daughter of Powhatan, who were drawing near the large boat in
      response to the invitation of him who was returning from his visit of
      state to the dusky Emperor. Nantaquas plied his paddle with renewed vigor,
      but instantly sheared away, and instead of keeping on as he had started,
      made with all speed for the northern shore. It was natural to think that
      the white men on the larger boat would undergo an instant change of
      feelings when the alarming sound fell upon their ears. Indeed, the youth
      expected a volley from the boat, but nothing of the kind was in the mind
      of Captain Smith, who did not interfere while <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_210">210</span>the canoe and its occupants rapidly passed from
      sight.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith walked hurriedly to the stern, where the others had gathered about
      the steersman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The settlement has been attacked," said the captain in his quick, crisp
      manner. "Listen!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All stood silent and motionless for several minutes. The <i>Sarah Constant</i>
      had three such pieces on board, fitted for good service, and Smith
      repeated that if it was necessary to discharge one of them, the urgency
      was equally great for the firing of the remainder. Be that as it may, the
      straining ears heard no second report, though the listening was long, and
      was repeated at intervals for a couple of hours later.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Naturally, the certainty that there was grave trouble at Jamestown
      intensified the impatience of Smith and his friends to reach the place as
      soon as they could. If <i>their</i> help was not needed, he knew <i>his</i>
      was, and he could not get there too quickly; but the fates were against
      him for the time. The wind, which had been dying out ever since sunset,
      now wholly ceased, and the rising tide began to carry them back towards
      the Indian capital. The anchor was dropped, and thus the craft lay at
      rest, as it must remain for several hours, awaiting the turn of the tide
      or perchance a rising of the wind. Two men were <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_211">211</span>placed on guard, and Smith and the others lay down
      to get such sleep as might come to them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The calm lasted throughout the night, and when daylight came the surface
      of the James was as smooth as a summer millpond. The tide had turned, but
      moved so sluggishly that Captain Smith told his skipper to let the anchor
      remain for a few hours, all agreeing that the weather signs foretold a
      change at or before that time. They partook sparingly of the coarse bread
      which they had brought with them, adding several mouthfuls of cold fowl
      that the Captain had shot a few miles below the spot on their upward
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      His next words caused surprise. He intended to go to the southern shore
      with two of the men, to inquire into the signal fire that had first caught
      his eye the night before. He hoped to learn something of the trouble at
      Jamestown, though his chief hope was that he might find the way to obtain
      a quantity of corn, of which his countrymen stood in sore need. From what
      Smith had been told, he knew that a small Indian village was not far
      inland. There was reason to hope that through barter, or possibly, as a
      last resort, the display of force, the owners could be made to part with a
      goodly supply of food.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A number of gaudy trinkets, beads, ribbons, fanciful little knives and
      gewgaws were <span class="pageno" id="Page_212">212</span>bundled up and
      put in the small boat, the three men took their places, with the Captain
      at the stern, while each of the others began to swing the oars in the
      fashion that has been common since time immemorial. They were old hands,
      and rowed in unison, while the craft headed toward the point which the
      Captain had pointed out before starting. In the hope that some of the
      warriors would show themselves, he keenly studied the shore, both above
      and below; but if there were any red men in the neighborhood, they took
      care that none should see them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the boat touched land the three stepped out, the two who had used the
      oars drawing the boat up the bank, and then awaited the orders of Captain
      Smith.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Each man had a knife, a musket, and ammunition. The guns were of what is
      known as the snaphaunce pattern, which took the place of the clumsy
      firelock during the previous century. The weapons were the old style
      flintlocks, heavy and cumbersome, but useful in the hands of those
      familiar with them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was but natural on the part of Captain John Smith to feel certain of
      his superiority in every respect over any and all of his associates. This
      included even marksmanship and skill in the use of fire arms. It was a
      common practice with him when engaging in a <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_213">213</span>hunt to go away from his companions. If asked for
      his reason, he replied that their presence prevented his success; he could
      do much better when alone. As for them, it did not matter, since they
      could never hope to be his equal.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      So it was that at the present time he told his friends to move off
      together, following the course of the stream, and never wandering so far
      in the woods that they could not easily make their way back to the water.
      If they met any Indians or made any important discovery they were to
      halloo at the top of their voices, and he would make haste to them and
      take charge of things. As for him, he would decide every question as it
      came up. It becomes necessary for us to give our attention to the two men,
      while we leave the doughty Captain for a time to himself.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The only sign of the recent presence of others on the spot was the heap of
      ashes left by the signal fire. This had been kindled within a few feet of
      the stream, where there was no vegetation to hide the rays. The trinkets
      which all hoped could be used for barter were left in the boat. Thus it
      will be seen that Smith did not mean that either he or his friends should
      go far from the spot.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was not strange that the name of one of the couple was also Smith, for
      we know that the name is the most common among civilized <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>people. I know a city of my own
      country in which I read in the directory exactly one hundred and five
      plain "John Smiths," and I doubt not that there are plenty of them in
      Great Britain. In the present instance, the Smith who had helped row the
      boat was no relation of the Captain. His companion was a cousin,
      remembered as Jack Bertram.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      These two moved up-stream-that is, toward the village of Powhatan. There
      was no reason to believe they would come upon anything of importance by
      keeping near the river, where the walking was easy, so they pushed inland
      for a number of rods, and then took a course parallel with the James. The
      timber was dense, and the undergrowth so matted that it was hard to force
      a passage. Smith took the lead, thus making the work less for Bertram, who
      kept close behind him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When they had pushed their way for a brief distance, Smith stopped.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What good can come of this? Since no one has been over the land ahead of
      us, we cannot overtake anyone."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They may be coming from the other way," said his companion, less
      discouraged because he was not doing such hard work in the way of
      traveling.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Little promise of that. I do not understand what Captain Smith hopes to
      learn or do by this groping through the woods. If we <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_215">215</span>knew the way to the Indian village we should go
      there, and, if they would not give us corn, take it from them. Ah! I did
      not look for this."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That which caused this exclamation was the sight of a well-marked trail
      leading over the course they were following. Both stopped to study it more
      closely.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It has been made by animals coming to the river to drink," said Bertram.
      "It can be of no help to us though it may be used also by persons."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith walked for a few paces, scanning the path, which soon turned to the
      left, leaning farther inland. At the same time the ground sloped gently
      upward, showing they were drawing near an elevation. Suddenly the leader
      halted. Glancing up, Bertram saw the reason for it, and then was as much
      astonished as his companion.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Standing in the trail, wonderingly staring at the couple, was the girl
      whom they had seen when the ships were sailing up the James River weeks
      before on their way to found the colony of Jamestown. There was no
      mistaking her. She had the same rich robe about her shoulders, and the
      same white plume curling over her mass of black hair that fell over her
      pretty shoulders. She carried her long bow in one hand, and the top of her
      quiver of arrows peeped from behind the left <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_216">216</span>shoulder. Her hands and moccasins were small, the
      latter ornamented with colored beads.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She caught sight of the white men before they saw her. She must have been
      coming over the path, when she observed the figures and stopped in
      amazement. On her comely face the emotion of astonishment was quickly
      followed by that of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is Pocahontas," whispered Bertram, at the rear of his friend; "we saw
      nothing of her yesterday at the lodge of the old chief, because she was
      absent. I wonder what she is doing here alone?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Her friends can't be far off. But I say, Jack, this is a godsend."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You will see."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The girl did not wait after observing that she was seen by the strangers.
      She knew where these men had come from, and, shifting her bow to her left
      hand as she walked, she came smilingly forward. She had noticed the
      strange custom of the pale-faces when they met of clasping their hands.
      Without pause she reached out her hand to Smith who was in front, and said
      to him in broken words:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How do? how do? Me friend; <i>you</i> friend."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith took the dainty palm, warmly pressed it, and then gave way to
      Bertram, as he stepped up beside him and did the same. <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_217">217</span>Pocahontas tried to say something more, but she
      knew so little of the English language that neither caught her meaning. It
      was amusing to note her sparkling eyes and charming smile as she saw that
      too many of her words were spoken in her own tongue for the men to
      understand them. Laughing in her childish way, she gave up the effort, and
      stood looking inquiringly into the bronzed faces before her, as if asking
      them to help her out of her trouble.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Jack," said Smith in a low voice, "the Indians have attacked Jamestown;
      we don't know how many of our people they have killed; we need food; let's
      take this daughter of the old chief and hold her as a hostage. We will
      give him the choice of letting us have all the corn we want, or of having
      his pet daughter put to death."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I hardly know what to say to that; it may work the other way."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It can't; Powhatan loves her so much that he will do anything to keep
      harm from coming to her."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith did not wait to argue further, but, taking a quick step toward the
      smiling girl, grasped her upper arm. In answer to her questioning look, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Go with us; we take to Jamestown; won't hurt."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The smiles gave way to an expression of alarm. She held back.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_218">218</span>"No. no, no. Me no go;
      Powhatan feel bad-much bad."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You <i>must</i> go!" said Smith, tightening his grip. "We not hurt you."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Bertram stood silent throughout the brief minutes. While he hardly liked
      the scheme that had been sprung so suddenly upon him, he thought it might
      turn out well, and therefore, he did not interfere.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And then Pocahontas, child that she was, began crying and striving to
      wrench her arm free from the iron fingers that had closed around it. She
      drew back so strongly that her feet slid forward beside each other. Had
      not Smith used much strength she would have got away from him. Impatient
      over her resistance, he next tried to scare her into submission. Scowling
      at her, he said in savage tones.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Stop! Come with me, or I kill!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This, it need not be said, was an idle threat, for the man had no thought
      of anything of the kind, though he was ready to use more violence to
      subdue the girl. Probably he would have struck her, for he was a
      quick-tempered man, and was fast losing his patience. Pocahontas would not
      stop her resistance, but as she found her moccasins sliding over the
      slippery leaves she struggled harder than ever, with the tears streaming
      down her cheeks. She begged and prayed but all her <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_219">219</span>words were in her own tongue. In her panic she
      could not stop to try to put them in the language of which she had only
      slight knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain John Smith had gone but a little way down stream, when he decided
      that he had taken the wrong course. He turned about and followed after his
      companions, coming upon them at the crisis of the struggle between his
      namesake and the young daughter of Powhatan. He paused only an instant,
      when he angrily cried out:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "What is the meaning of this?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other Smith merely glanced around at his leader, and kept dragging the
      captive along the trail. It was Bertram who hastily said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "She is the daughter of Powhatan. We are going to take her to Jamestown,
      to hold her as a hostage, and make the chief give us what corn--"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Without waiting for anything further, the Captain sprang forward, calling
      angrily:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Let go! Release her!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Before the amazed fellow could comply, he was grasped by the back of the
      collar. Captain Smith shifted his gun to his right hand, so as to leave
      the other free. The fingers were as those of a giant, and the scared
      Englishman let go of the sobbing prisoner. As he did so the Captain gave a
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>kick with his goodly right
      foot, which lifted his namesake clear off the ground, and sent him
      tumbling on his face, his peaked hat falling off, and his gun flying
      several yards away.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I would do right to kill you!" called the leader, his face aflame as he
      glared down on the fellow, who began climbing shame-facedly to his feet.
      "Among all the Indians in Virginia there is not one so good a friend of
      the English as that little girl."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As he spoke he pointed towards the spot where she stood a minute before,
      but she was not there. She had taken instant advantage of her release, and
      fled beyond sight.

        CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">AT JAMESTOWN</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Captain Smith's burst of tempestuous anger was caused, in the first place,
      by the unpardonable violence shown to the gentle Pocahontas, a girl so
      young that she was not yet far in her "teens." In the sweetness of her
      nature she had shown perfect trust in the white men, and, early as it was
      in the settlement of Virginia, all knew she had no feeling but friendship
      for the people that had made their homes within the country of her father,
      the great Powhatan. What a rude awakening was hers! What injury it was
      likely to do to those who were in sore need of the good will of the
      powerful tribes around them!
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A second cause of the Captain's wrath was the fact, clear to him, that the
      outrage, apart from its wickedness, was the worst thing possible when
      viewed as to its results to the white men themselves. Instead of alarming
      Powhatan and forcing him to help them, it would have the contrary effect.
      It would add to his ill will, and lead him to measures that otherwise
      might have been <span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>averted.
      (This, as you shall learn, was proved some years later, when Captain
      Argall stole Pocahontas, and came nigh causing the complete destruction of
      Jamestown and the settlements.)
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Not only that, but the immediate results were sure to be disastrous. It
      was not to be supposed that Pocahontas was alone thus far from her home.
      She certainly had friends near at hand, she was already fleeing with her
      story; she would reach them in a brief while, and they would hasten to
      punish her enemies.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      These thoughts flashed through the mind of Captain Smith, while the victim
      of his anger was slowly climbing to his feet. He took a step towards his
      namesake, meaning to strike him to the earth again, but the man shrank
      away, with no word of protest. The Captain checked himself and said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We must hasten to the boat before we are cut off. Come!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The fellow picked up his hat and gun, and Captain Smith led the way at a
      rapid stride over the trail and through the dense undergrowth, till they
      reached the margin of the stream, along which they hurried to the spot
      where the prow of the craft had been drawn up the bank. He pushed it free
      and stepped within. Instead of seating himself at the stern, he did so at
      the bow, <span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>so that he faced the
      shore they were leaving, as did the two who hastily sat down and caught up
      the oars. The one who was named Smith was nearest the stern, his companion
      being between him and the Captain, with all three, as has been shown,
      looking towards the shore they were fast leaving behind them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Row hard," said the Captain, "for you have no time to spare."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Neither of the men had spoken a word since the rescue of Pocahontas, and
      they bent to their oars with the utmost energy. They knew they had done
      wrong, and naught was left but to obey the command of their leader, which
      they did with right good will.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The tide was sweeping down stream so fast that the craft took a diagonal
      position under the impulse of the oar, this being necessary to hold a
      direct course to the waiting boat in midstream. The three had not reached
      a point fifty yards from land, when a young Indian warrior dashed through
      the undergrowth into the open space on the beach. He was Nantaquas, and
      almost at his side was his sister Pocahontas. He held his long bow, firmly
      gripped in the middle by his left hand, and had drawn an arrow from the
      quiver behind his shoulder, which was partly fitted to the string of
      deer-thong. The girl pointed excitedly to the man Smith <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span>who was rowing, and who was nearer
      to them than either of the others. She was showing the guilty man to her
      brother, who had probably asked the question of her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Look out!" warned the Captain. "He means to shoot you!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The endangered fellow was so flustered that he broke the regularity of the
      strokes of the two, though Jack Bertram strove hard to catch it again. He
      kept his eye on the young warrior, who rigidly straightened his left arm,
      with the hand gripping the middle of the long bow, while he drew the
      feathered arrow to its head, and sighted at the alarmed oarsman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith watched Nantaquas, not allowing the slightest movement to
      escape him. Suddenly he called:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "<i>Down!</i>"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The other Smith instantly flung himself forward on his face, so that he
      was hidden by the low gunwale. Bertram, hardly knowing what he did, dodged
      to one side. The Captain did not stir. He knew <i>he</i> was in no danger.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At the same moment that the oarsman went down Nantaquas launched his
      arrow, which came with such swiftness that it made a flickering streak in
      the sunlight which the eye could hardly follow. Captain Smith caught a
      glimpse of something like the flitting <span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>of
      a bird's wing, and the missile flashed over the very spot where the
      intended victim had been sitting an instant before, driven with such
      unerring aim that, but for his quickness, the arrow would have been buried
      in his chest.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      So great was the power with which the missile was fired that it seemed to
      dart horizontally outward for nearly a hundred feet beyond the boat before
      it dipped enough for the point to drop into the water, where it turned
      rapidly over several times, and the flint-head sank below the surface.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Brief as was the time, the oarsman partly regained his coolness. He raised
      his head, but instead of drawing upon his oars he dropped them, and
      reached for the musket at his feet. His companion kept toiling with all
      his strength.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Drop that!" thundered Captain Smith. "It would serve you right if you
      were killed! <i>Use your oars!</i>"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The two men, in their flurry, forgot to hold the boat to the right course,
      so that it took a more direct one than before. Had this been done from the
      first, Nantaquas could not have launched his arrow without endangering
      Captain Smith, since he would have been in the line of aim. At any moment
      the Captain could have shot Nantaquas, who stood out in the clear view, or
      either of <span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>his companions
      could have done the same, but the leader would not allow it. He
      sympathized with the "prince," and though he did not care to have the
      offender slain, he would not permit any injury to be done to Nantaquas.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The youth had fitted another arrow to his bow, and now drew it to the
      head. The keen eyes of Captain Smith noted every movement. He saw that
      after drawing his right hand half-way back, Nantaquas held it stationary.
      He saw that if he fired again, and the man serving as his target dodged,
      the arrow was likely to strike Captain Smith, unless he was equally quick
      in eluding it. Moreover, the distance was increasing so fast that every
      second added to the difficulty of the shot. He knew which man had
      befriended Pocahontas, and eager as he was to slay the criminal, he must
      forego that pleasure in order to spare the friend.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Holding the long bow poised for a few seconds, he slowly lowered it, still
      keeping the notch of the arrow pressed against the string, as if expecting
      a new chance to present itself. If the boat would turn partially sideways
      toward him, as at first, he might still bring down his man; but the
      oarsman had learned wherein their safety lay, and took care to make no
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All this time the boat was moving rapidly, <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_227">227</span>and it was not long before it passed beyond
      bowshot.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas remained standing in full view on the shore, his sister beside
      him, both watching the receding craft until it came alongside the large
      one, and the three stepped aboard, leaving the small boat to be towed at
      the stern. Then brother and sister turned about, and passed from sight in
      the forest.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A brisk breeze was blowing, and Captain Smith and his companions had
      hardly joined their friends when the anchor was hoisted, and they were
      carried at good speed toward Jamestown, which they reached early that
      afternoon. There they learned that the settlement had passed through a
      trying experience during the absence of Captain Smith and his party.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Although the Englishmen arrived at the site of Jamestown rather late in
      the season for planting, and although many of them were too indolent to
      work, others did what they could to make up for the lost time. In the rich
      soil, which had been cleared of trees, corn that had been obtained from
      the Indians was planted, and quickly showed a vigor of growth that
      promised the best results.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On the day that Captain Smith sailed up the James to make his call of
      state upon Powhatan, more than twenty men were engaged in planting and
      cultivating the corn <span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span>already
      put in the ground. Without any warning, and when no one dreamed of danger,
      the woods near by began raining arrows. They came in bewildering showers,
      amid the shouts of the Indians, of whom only occasional glimpses were
      caught, as they flitted from tree to tree, while they used the trunks as
      shields. The English, stricken with panic, dropped their implements and
      ran behind the stockades, which had been finished only a short time
      before. Hurried as was their flight, those who glanced behind them saw one
      man lying motionless on his face. He was dead, pierced by so many arrows
      that he looked like a huge porcupine. Nearly all the others had been
      struck, some of them two or three times; and when they ran panting through
      the open gate the missiles were still sticking in their bodies and
      clothing. Actual count showed that seventeen men had been wounded, most of
      them slightly, though three or four seemed likely to die of their hurts.
      Happily, however, all recovered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Instead of leaving, the Indians kept their places in the woods,
      continually launching their arrows at the settlers. While these were
      harmless when directed against the stockades, some of the warriors showed
      great skill in curving them so that they dropped inside the defences. It
      required keen watchfulness <span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>on
      the part of the defenders to save themselves from being badly hurt, for,
      when a sharp-pointed missile comes almost straight downward from a height
      of more than a hundred feet, it is likely to do fatal damage. The
      Englishmen could protect themselves from mishaps, but could do little in
      the way of driving off their assailants while they were so well shielded
      among the trees.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Matters stood thus when the <i>Sarah Constant</i> took a hand. Dropping a
      little way down stream, so as to get clear range of the stretch of woods
      in which their enemies shielded themselves while keeping up their attack,
      she discharged two of her cannon that were loaded to the muzzle with
      slugs. It is not likely that any of the warriors were hurt by the
      missiles, but when they saw large limbs splintered and falling about their
      heads, and heard the rattle among the leaves and twigs overhead and about
      them, they were terrified, and scurried off in as headlong a panic as that
      of the settlers when attacked by the red men.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Not another foe was seen during the day, though there could be no doubt
      that more than one pair of black eyes were peeping from among the
      vegetation, the owners, no doubt, wondering as to the nature of the awful
      weapon that could tear the big branches from the trees. Some time after
      dark, however, <span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>the sentinels
      heard sounds in the woods near at hand, which showed that their enemies
      had returned, and, of course, were plotting mischief. The larger vessel,
      which had held her place after driving off the Indians earlier in the day,
      now fired another assortment of missiles, and this ended all trouble of
      that nature for some time to follow. It was the report of this cannon
      which had travelled up the James to the boat where Captain Smith sat
      meditatively smoking.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The first attack on Jamestown brought good results. It was clear to all
      that the settlement must have a vigorous head, and that he must be a
      military man. Wingfield, as has been shown, had no qualification whatever
      for the office. He must be displaced, or the colony would go to ruin.
      Smith was determined on his removal, and as a first step he demanded that
      a trial by jury should be given himself on the charges made long before,
      and for which he was still under arrest.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Wingfield refused, and when Smith insisted he replied that he would send
      him back to England to be tried by the authorities there.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You will not!" said the angry Captain. "The charter provides for the
      trial of all such charges in Virginia; it is my right, and I will not be
      denied it!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>So, against his will, the
      Governor gave Smith his trial, which was the first one by jury in America;
      and never did an accused man gain a greater triumph. Every charge brought
      against him was shown to be false: the witnesses broke down, and those who
      swore that Captain Smith had plotted to obtain the mastery of the colony
      were proved to have sworn falsely. He might have been boastful and
      overbearing at times, but he was unselfish, and always thought of the real
      interests of those who had crossed the ocean with him to found homes in
      the New World. Smith was not only declared innocent of the shameful
      charges, but his chief persecutor, a member of the Council, was ordered to
      pay a fine of 200 pounds. When this large sum was handed to Smith, he gave
      it to the colony for the general use. Then all parties partook of the
      Communion, declared themselves friends, and Smith took his seat as a
      member of the Council.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      He had no wish to be Governor or President, though he knew the day was
      near when no one else would be able to save the colony. He had a freer
      hand in certain matters while simply Councillor, and was willing that the
      people should become tired of Wingfield before he stepped into his shoes.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      We cannot dwell upon the miseries of that first summer in Jamestown. The
      sickness, <span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>caused by paying no
      heed to the laws of health, rapidly grew worse. It looked for a time as if
      disease would carry off every man. They lay groaning and fever-smitten in
      their cabins, until no thought was given to the danger from the Indians.
      Had Powhatan, or any other leader, chosen to attack Jamestown with only a
      score of warriors, he would have had no trouble in destroying every man.
      Even Captain Smith, who seemed safe against every disease and weakness,
      took the fever, but refused to give up, and with the help of a few others
      he was able to drag out and bury the dead. Among those who passed away
      were the good Bartholomew Gosnold and Studley, the treasurer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There remained, however, Wingfield, the corrupt and wicked President, and
      the one who had been defeated in the trial of Smith. The two were his
      bitter enemies, and they formed a plot which, if successful, would not
      only ruin Smith, but would probably destroy the colony itself.

        CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">UP THE CHICKAHOMINY</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      When September came one-half of the Jamestown colony had passed away, and
      most of the survivors were tottering with weakness and disease. I have
      said that for weeks theses wretched beings could have hardly raised a hand
      to keep off the Indians had they chosen to attack them; but instead of
      that, Providence moved the hearts of the red men to pity, and they brought
      corn to the sufferers, though the supply was so scant that it could last
      but a short time.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Newport had sailed for England several months before for food and
      supplies, but could not be expected back for a long time to come. He left
      one of the smaller boats for the use of the colonists, and Wingfield and
      another plotted to seize it and sail to the Mother Country. When they
      tried to do so, however, the others were so indignant that they not only
      stopped them, but turned them out of the Council, and chose John Ratcliffe
      as President. He was little better than Wingfield, and the settlers now
      compelled Smith to take charge of the colony.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain quickly proved his worth. <span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>He
      gave the people to understand that every well man must choose whether to
      work or starve. He would have no idlers, and he set the example by toiling
      as hard as the best of them. On his return from an expedition down the
      river, where he forced a surly tribe to trade corn with him, he arrived
      just as Wingfield and his friend, who had again seized the pinnace, were
      about to sail. Smith opened fire on them with a cannon, and would have
      sunk the craft had they not surrendered. Their action was so base that
      they were tried by jury. The life of Wingfield was spared, but all
      authority was taken from him; while his companion, as the greater offender
      of the two, was condemned to death and shot.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      With the coming of cool weather a great improvement took place in the
      health of the colonists. Disease abated, and on the appearance of frost
      all fever disappeared. Those who had been ill rapidly regained their
      health. The river abounded with fish and fowl, and the yellowing corn
      could be made into bread. For the first time the future looked bright,
      even though so many had died. Other immigrants were sure to arrive ere
      long, and were believed even then to be on their way across the ocean.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      How prone are we to forget favors done to us! No man of colonial times
      earned a <span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>heavier debt of
      gratitude than Captain John Smith of Virginia, and yet, when things
      improved, those whom he had been the means of saving complained because he
      had not done more. He gave up the Presidency as the best means of teaching
      the people his value to them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Of course, you know that Christopher Columbus died under the belief that,
      instead of discovering a continent, he had simply found the eastern shore
      of India. The belief was held by nearly everybody during more than a
      century that followed, that America was only a narrow strip of land,
      beyond which stretched the "South Sea." They thought that by sailing up
      any of the large streams they would reach that vast body of water. When
      Captain Henry Hudson passed up the noble river, named for him, in 1609, he
      expected to keep on till his little ship entered the South Sea. It was
      because of this universal belief that England, in granting land to most of
      her colonists, made the western boundary the Pacific Ocean, or South Sea,
      which I need not remind you was discovered by Balboa in 1512.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Thus it was that the colony which settled Jamestown was ordered to hunt
      for the South Sea. Captain Smith was reproached in Council for not
      carrying out this royal <span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>command,
      and because of such neglect his surly associates declared that the whole
      enterprise was a failure. I have often wondered whether the sensible
      Captain had any faith in this wild dream. Be that as it may, he replied to
      the fault-finding by declaring he would set out at once in quest of the
      missing sea. I cannot help thinking that when he was stung into making
      this answer, he was led to do so by his disgust with affairs at home, but
      more by his love of adventure. He must have felt that it would be a great
      relief to get away from the quarrelling people, who would learn his worth
      during his absence, while he would gain an experience for which he longed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      If you will glance at your map once more you will notice that a large
      tributary empties into the James River from the north, about ten miles
      west of Jamestown. It is the Chickahominy, and its sources are well to the
      westward in the direction of the mountains which form the most romantic
      section of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was on a clear, cold day, early in December, that Smith started on his
      eventful voyage in a barge propelled by a crew of half a dozen sturdy men,
      besides two friendly Indians. As he meant to ascend the river, as far as
      possible, he trailed a smaller boat behind the barge-the same that he used
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>when he went ashore to learn
      the meaning of the signal fire on the southern bank of the James. This
      craft promised to be useful when he had gone as far as the barge could go,
      while it could also be turned to account by himself in hunting for game
      that would be scared away by sight of the larger boat, whose advance could
      not be as well hidden as the smaller one.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The barge, as it was called, was provided with a sail, which must prove of
      great help for a part of the time at least, while the small half-cabin at
      the stern gave sleeping room for the "shift" when off duty. There were
      plenty of blankets, though the size of the craft allowed no use of a fire
      as a means of warmth. There were three row-locks on each side, to be
      called into play when the wind was not favorable, besides the numerous
      times when they would have to use the poles with which to push the boat
      through the water. A scant supply of "pone," or corn bread, and venison
      was brought, but the main reliance of the party was upon the fish that
      were to be taken from the stream, and the fowl and game that could be shot
      along shore or in the woods.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the barge left Jamestown not a flake of snow was to be seen anywhere,
      though winter had begun, and the climate in that section is sometimes
      severe. A strong <span class="pageno" id="Page_238">238</span>breeze was
      blowing from the eastward, and the craft moved easily forward without
      calling the oars into use. Most of the course of the Chickahominy is
      through a swampy section, choked by fallen trees, where navigation is
      difficult. Captain Smith had sailed for a few miles above its mouth some
      weeks before, but the region was unknown to him. Because of this fact it
      was the more pleasing, for, as you know, the prospect of stirring
      adventure was one which he was never able to resist. During his stay in
      Virginia he explored so many waters in the neighborhood of Chesapeake Bay,
      that the distance covered was equal to the breadth of the Atlantic between
      Liverpool and New York.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was yet early in the day when the barge turned to the right and entered
      the broad mouth of the large branch of the James. The sun, shining in a
      clear sky, moderated the cold, so that with their blankets about their
      forms the men were comfortable. The two Indians used only the deerskin
      jackets of covering for the upper part of their bodies. Thus clothed, they
      would have felt no discomfort had the temperature been at zero. Each had
      his bow and arrows, the white men being provided with the snaphaunce
      muskets or old-fashioned flintlocks.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>Captain Smith seated himself
      at the stern, just back of the little cabin, his hand resting on the end
      of the tiller, which was held between his elbow and side. In this position
      it was the easiest thing in the world to direct the course of the boat.
      The others placed themselves as fancy prompted, all ready for any work
      when called upon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Seated thus, the explorer was in a good position to study the country as
      they moved between the banks. The woods had a sameness, though they could
      never lose their interest to the crew, who knew they were the first of
      their race to gaze upon the forests, with the matted vines, the trees
      bending far over the surface, while rotting log, interlocked limbs, and
      fragments of trunks were mixed in such confusion that the boat had not
      gone far when the Captain had to change his direct course to a winding one
      so as to have a clear passage. Looking over the gunwale he saw that in
      most places the water was clear, though the color of the soil at the
      bottom gave it a dark appearance. Sometimes this depth was eight or ten
      feet, and then it became so slight that he was not surprised to feel the
      process slacken, and then cease so gently that few noticed it. The boat
      had grounded upon a marshy spot, and the wind could carry it no further.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith spoke to his men, and <span class="pageno" id="Page_240">240</span>four
      of them seized each a pole and rose to their feet. When the ends were
      thrust against the oozy bottom they sank deep into the mud. Instead of
      trying to push the craft ahead, they shoved so as to drive it back into
      deeper water. This was not difficult, the chief work being that of
      withdrawing the ends of the poles from the soft earth, so as not to bring
      the hull back to its former place. When the depth had increased the boat
      was steered to one side of the shoal, and the sail not having been
      lowered, it moved on again, though at so moderate a speed that some
      minutes passed before even Captain Smith was certain they were really
      advancing.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      All this time the occupants of the barge were on the watch for Indians.
      Our friends were entering the hunting-grounds of the red men whose tribal
      name was that which was given to the river, and it was not to be expected
      that they would long remain ignorant of the coming of the visitors.
      Nothing would have been easier than for some of these warriors, lurking in
      the wooded depths along shore, to launch a shower of arrows that would be
      likely to do harm, even though Smith and those of his race were protected
      by rude coats of mail. But while this might have guarded their limbs and
      bodies, their faces were left without any shield whatever.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>When the sun was overhead the
      two men seated nearest the cabin brought out the black, coarse bread and
      cold venison. With the aid of knives these were cut into rough pieces and
      divided among all. Butter, pepper, and salt were not thought of, and those
      who wished to wash down their food did so by dipping up water from the
      river in the palm of the hand, or, in the case of the Captain, by lifting
      it in a small tin cup.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      About the middle of the afternoon the breeze fell, and the flapping sail
      told the navigators that they must use the oars. Four were slipped into
      place, and two pairs of sturdy arms bent to the task, the others awaiting
      their turn. The Indians who sat near the bow, silent and watchful, were
      not expected to take part in the labor, for it was of a nature with which
      they were not familiar. The Captain had told them to use their woodcraft
      to detect any danger, and the two were scanning the shores as they opened
      out before them, on the alert for the first warning sign.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Suddenly one of the red men uttered a hissing sound. Faint as it was all
      heard it. The rowers instantly stopped, and Captain Smith looked
      inquiringly at the Indians. The one who had emitted the signal pointed in
      advance and to the right bank. The river at this place was more than two
      hundred <span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>yards broad, the
      trees growing close to the shore and many in the water itself. Several
      white oaks curved out almost horizontally over the surface before turning
      upward and becoming upright. Many interlocking vines showed, but it was
      the season of the year when the foliage was absent, and only here and
      there was an evergreen seen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Not a white man could discover the cause of the warning. So far as they
      were able to see, they were the only living creatures in the neighborhood.
      As yet they had not caught sight of a deer, bear, or even a fowl, and more
      than one began to believe that a disappointment awaited them over the
      supply of game. That the dusky guard had detected something, however, was
      certain. In answer to Smith's inquiry he said, speaking in his own tongue,
      that an Indian was near them on shore. There might be more, but certainly
      there was one. After a minute's pause the Captain ordered the men at the
      oars to renew work. As they did so he steered the boat a little to the
      left, but, like everyone else, kept his attention upon the spot where it
      looked as if danger was lurking.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The guard was right, for, when nearly opposite the place, all who were on
      watch saw not one warrior, but two partly hidden, by the trees and
      undergrowth. Their position <span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>was
      slightly crouching, and their attention was fixed upon the white men. They
      had the bows and arrows of their people, and one of them seemed to be
      fixing a missile to the string of his weapon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      While all were watching the Indian, not really certain as to his
      intention, he suddenly aimed, and let his arrow fly. It flashed in the
      sunlight, but was so poorly directed that it passed ten feet over the
      heads of the crew, and dropped into the water beyond.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hardly had it done so, when Captain Smith reached down and caught up his
      musket lying at his feet. He aimed at the daring warrior, and, pausing
      only a moment, pulled the trigger. He was a better marksman then the
      other, who was struck by the bullet, which, if it did not inflict serious
      hurt, caused a twinge which threw the fellow into a panic. With a yell he
      whirled on his feet and dashed into the wood, his equally frightened
      companion crashing through the undergrowth at his heels. The crew broke
      into laughter, and two or three would have fired at the fleeing couple had
      the Captain permitted it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith had done a prudent thing, for, had he made no reply to the attack,
      his foes would have thought it due to fear, and would have pressed the
      white men. Nothing further of that nature was to be feared from <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>the two, nor from any of their
      friends whom they could tell of the occurrence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The men at the oars now gave place to others, and the ascent of the
      Chickahominy continued until night began closing in. By that time they had
      reached the edge of the famous White Oak Swamp, where some of the severest
      battles were fought during the great Civil War of 1861-5. They found it
      composed of lagoons, morasses and stretches of wide-spreading ponds or
      lakes choked with trees, and abounding with shallow places, where the
      expanses of sluggish water were so broad and winding that it was hard to
      keep to the channel. The barge was anchored in the middle of one of these
      small lakes, the Captain deeming it unsafe to camp on shore, though
      nothing further had been seen of Indians. After partaking of a frugal meal
      the men lay down for the night, two of their number mounting guard. The
      Captain longed for a smoke, but there was danger of the light drawing the
      attention of their enemies, and again he set a good example to his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      After night had fully come, the anchor was gently lifted, and with the aid
      of the long poles, the position of the craft was shifted a number of rods
      down stream. This was meant to make it hard for any warriors prowling in
      the vicinity to find the boat. <span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>They
      would naturally seek it where it was last seen in the gathering gloom, and
      failing to discover it, would have to look elsewhere.

        CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">PARTING COMPANY</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      It happened that the two men who were first to mount guard were our old
      acquaintances, Smith and Bertram, who had gone ashore with Captain Smith
      some months before, when the first named tried to abduct Pocahontas, the
      daughter of Powhatan, and might have succeeded but for the interference of
      the Captain.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Bertram's position was at the bow, while Smith was at the stern, near the
      small cabin. When the Captain gave them this duty he warned both to be on
      the alert during every minute of the time. The Indians were so cunning
      that if they knew of the presence of the barge in the river they would try
      some trick upon the whites, and the deception might take any one of a
      score of forms. The important order to the sentinels was that, whenever
      they saw anything suspicious, they were to fire upon it, for, in doing so,
      they could not fail to teach their enemies an important lesson.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And," significantly added the leader, "gunpowder is valuable. <i>Don't
      waste it.</i>"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Bertram sat with his blanket wrapped <span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>about
      his shoulders and his musket resting beside him, where it could be caught
      up at a moment's warning. His companion did the same at the stern. The
      night was cold, and since they were prevented from warming their blood by
      moving about, they felt the chill despite the protection. When it seemed
      to them that midnight had come, they were to call two of their friends and
      change places with them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Soon after the couple had gone on guard, a gentle wind arose. It sighed
      dismally among the leafless branches on shore, and caused a faint rippling
      against the hull, which added to the loneliness of the place. No sound of
      wild animal or signal of men was heard amid the chilling solitude around
      them. The lowering of the temperature was so recent that the boat had met
      no ice on its way, though a few needlelike points began putting out from
      the swampy shore, and more of it was likely to form within the next few
      days.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Bertram had held his place for nearly two hours without hearing or seeing
      anything to cause misgiving. Deep, impenetrable darkness shut in the boat.
      In no direction could the watchers catch the faintest outline of the
      shore. The sky was partly cloudy, and the new moon was hidden, though a
      few stars twinkled overhead <span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>without
      adding any light to the impressive scene.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was no danger of either of the men falling asleep while at his post.
      They might have done so had they tried to watch until daybreak. As it was,
      they continued as vigilant as if pacing to and fro in front of a camp
      fire.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At the end of the time named Bertram heard a sound that he knew meant
      danger. It was so faint that he was neither sure of its nature nor of the
      point whence it came. He shoved down the top of the blanket from his ears
      and listened. Fancying that the noise had been on his right, he leaned
      forward in the effort to penetrate the gloom, and closed one hand about
      the barrel of his musket.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Five or ten minutes of silence followed, when he heard the noise
      again-still faint, but distinct enough to show its nature as well as its
      direction. It was made by the dip of a paddle, and his first impression of
      the point whence the sound came was right. Beyond a doubt, a party of
      Indians in a canoe were hunting for the barge.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Bertram did not signal to his companion, for he might be held by some
      discovery of his own. He leaned farther over the gunwale and peered into
      the darkness. He lifted his gun so that it lay across his knee, and
      smothering the click made by the lock, drew back <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_249">249</span>the clumsy hammer, with the bit of yellow flint
      clutched in its maw.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Thus gazing, he made out a shadowy something, which looked like a section
      of the gloom, resting on the water. It was moving very slowly, neither
      approaching the barge nor receding from it, but seemingly making a circuit
      of the craft. It was a canoe, but instead of completing the circuit on
      which it had started, it paused when just in front of the bow.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The sentinel thought that it would not stay motionless long, but would
      pass on, probably coming nearer the larger boat; but minute after minute
      passed without any change of its position. Several times when Bertram was
      intently looking he was sure there was nothing in sight; but, upon
      shifting his gaze for a moment and bringing it back again, his doubt
      vanished. The canoe was there, though he could not tell how many persons
      it contained.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Perplexed and uncertain of what he ought to do he emitted a cautious call
      to his companion, who stealthily made his way to his side.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Have you seen anything amiss?" asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Naught whatever. How is it with you?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "A few yards in front of us a canoe has halted, but it is so dimly seen
      that I am in <span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>doubt whether to
      fire or not. What do you make of it?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      With one hand on the shoulder of his friend, Smith leaned as far over as
      he could, and gazed into the gloom.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is there," he whispered; "and, if I am not mistaken, it is full of
      warriors."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Then I will do as the Captain commanded."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And I will await the result before I fire."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The hammer of Bertram's gun being already raised, he softly brought the
      stock to his shoulder, first dropping the blanket so as to leave his arm
      free. He sighted carefully, but was checked by the same difficulty as
      before; as he fixed his vision on the target it seemed to melt in the
      darkness, and he could not make sure of his aim.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I cannot see it," he muttered in vexation. "Do <i>you</i> fire."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is idle; it has gone."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This was true. During the brief moments taken to aim, the canoe had glided
      off in the gloom, and the keenest scrutiny on the part of both could not
      locate it. Smith picked his way to the stern, and the two kept watch until
      well beyond midnight. Then they roused two of their friends, and told them
      what they had seen, and urged them to unusual vigilance. But, though they
      obeyed, they discovered nothing to <span class="pageno" id="Page_251">251</span>cause
      alarm, nor were the canoe and its occupants seen or heard of again. It was
      fair to believe that the warriors, after studying the large boat as best
      they could in the gloom, agreed that it was too dangerous for them to
      attack, and went away.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The two succeeding days were marked by toil and discouragement. Only for a
      brief time did the sail give any help, and there were hours when the oars
      were useless because of the many obstructions. Three times the crew had to
      saw their way through the logs and branches, and more than once, after
      poling hard for a long while, they could not see that they had made any
      progress. Fortunately the Indians did not disturb them. It was on the
      second day that a solitary warrior was noticed. He was leaping from log to
      log on his way across one of the many streams, knowing nothing, as it
      seemed, of the presence of the strange visitors. Not once did he turn his
      head, but whisked out of sight the moment his moccasin rested on dry land,
      as if he had business that would not admit of delay.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Finally, it was seen that the large boat was of no further aid in going up
      the Chickahominy. Use must be made of the small one trailing at the rear,
      which had served when they had to chop and saw their way through the
      obstructions. Smith would have <span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>been
      warranted in turning back and giving his energies to the exploration of
      other branches of the James, but such was not his nature. He said he would
      take the two Indians and a couple of his own men with him, and go up the
      stream as far he could.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The day was so near at its close that he decided not to start until the
      next morning. The chief thing to be feared was the red men, who were known
      to roam and hunt through the region. The fact that, after the exchange of
      shots several days before, they had seen only the single warrior, was good
      evidence that nothing of the kind threatened; but Captain Smith was not
      quite satisfied. He sent his friendly red men ashore with orders to scout
      the woods in every direction for signs of their countrymen, while he urged
      upon the guards to use sleepless vigilance throughout the night.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The disturbing feature must be borne in mind. Near the spot where the
      Captain had decided to part company with his companions they had seen an
      Indian leaping across the logs. What more likely than that he had friends
      in the neighborhood, whom he had joined shortly after observing the barge,
      and had told them of his discovery?
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      What would be done by these warriors? Would they give no attention to the
      white men, or would they join in a plan for their <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_253">253</span>destruction? These were the questions which Smith
      could not answer, and which explained why he sent the friendly Indians to
      land with orders to scour the woods on every hand.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The result quieted the fears of the Captain. His scouts did not come back
      till late at night when they reported that they had not seen any of their
      own people, nor a sign of their presence in the vicinity. Furthermore, his
      men who kept watch on the boat did not discover anything to cause
      misgiving. This seemed to mean that no danger threatened, and yet it might
      mean one or two other things that were by no means so pleasant to think
      upon. The enemies, observing the hunt made for them, would have had little
      trouble in keeping out of sight. A still darker theory was that the scouts
      knew that a large number of warriors was in the woods, and possibly
      reached an understanding with them. Whether this was true or not can never
      be known, but the fact remains that there was at that very time a large
      party of red men near by, and the conduct of one of the friendlies some
      time after makes the theory named reasonable.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The barge was rowed to the middle of a broad expanse of water, where the
      woods were quite far off in every direction, and the anchor was dropped
      into the soft bottom. Smith meant to take the two Indians and <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>the same number of his own men with
      him. His namesake and Bertram asked the privilege of being his companions,
      but he declined. He had not felt very friendly towards them since the
      affair with Pocahontas, and in the event of trouble with any of Powhatan's
      tribes, the presence of the two as his comrades might prove dangerous to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Before leaving he addressed the four who remained in charge of the barge.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "No matter what happens after I am gone, not one of you must go ashore.
      You cannot do so without working the boat to land, and that is, perhaps,
      what the red men are waiting for you to do. Stay here till I come back."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But suppose, Captain," said Bertram, with a grin, "you do <i>not</i> come
      back?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Wait for three days, if you see nothing of me then, turn the prow down
      stream, and make all haste for Jamestown."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "And what shall we say when we get there?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Say what you please," replied the Captain impatiently. "I don't doubt you
      will sprinkle plenty of falsehood in your words."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was so much easier to go up the Chickahominy in the smaller boat, that
      Smith thought it likely he would continue the ascent of the river for
      several days. He meant to press on as far as he could go in the craft.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_255">255</span>Whether he should venture
      beyond that on foot must depend upon circumstances.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Thus five men entered the small boat, which, you remember, was provided
      with two pairs of oars, but had no sail. The white men did the rowing,
      while the Indians stoically looked on, willing, if asked, to take one of
      the blades in hand, and ply it as they were accustomed to use their own
      paddles.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At the moment of starting a slight flurry of snow carried the flakes
      against their faces, but it ceased in a few minutes, and the weather
      became more moderate than at any time since leaving Jamestown. This was
      pleasant, for no ice of account showed in the stream in which they must
      remain for some time to come.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith had not been gone half an hour when those left behind in the
      barge boat gave voice to their discontent over the command he had laid
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It is unbearable to stay here for two or three days," said his namesake,
      who was seated at the bow, looking with a glum expression at his
      companions. "How shall we spend the weary hours?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "We might fish," said Bertram with a grin.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That would answer for a little while, but the fish do not bite readily in
      this wintry weather, and we shall grow tired."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The scouts who spent so much time ashore <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_256">256</span>told us that no Indians were near; <i>that</i>
      ought to satisfy us. Let us go ashore, where we can stretch our limbs and
      perhaps find game."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The proposal was in direct disregard of the order of their leader, but it
      was agreeable to each of the four men. They can hardly be blamed for
      feeling as they did over the prospect of remaining in virtual imprisonment
      so long, but their act, none the less, was wrong. Bertram and Smith rose
      to their feet and began plying their poles. The water was five or six feet
      in depth, and under their efforts the craft began sidling toward land.
      While the couple were toiling the others scanned the wooded bank which
      they were nearing. They must have felt a misgiving, for each laid his
      musket across his knee, and one of them wrinkled his brows and shook his
      head, but said nothing, and the poles were used with a vigor that steadily
      lessened the fifty yards or more it was necessary to pass to reach land.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The point at which the boat was directed was an open space, several square
      yards in extent, and favorable for stepping ashore from the craft. Beyond
      and on the two sides stretched the wood, with its rank undergrowth and
      matted vines. If there was any current it was too sluggish to be noted.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The side of the boat was so near the bank <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_257">257</span>that it was a slight leap for any one. Smith was
      standing with his pole motionless, and on the point of making the jump,
      when one of his friends, who had also risen, gun in hand, called out in an
      excited undertone:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Back-quick! The woods are full of Indians!"

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      It was fortunate, that when the Indians warriors swarmed out of the woods
      to attack the boat so near shore, the four white men on board did not lose
      their presence of mind. This was partly due to the feeling which had come,
      more or less, to every one, that they were doing a dangerous thing in thus
      disobeying the order of Captain John Smith. Thus they were partly prepared
      for that which broke upon them with so much suddenness.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith and Bertram used the poles to the utmost, despite the arrows
      whizzing about them. They pushed so hard that the boat quickly yielded,
      and the space between it and the land widened with every moment. Their
      companions aimed their muskets at the crowding forms, and fired with such
      skill that each brought down a warrior.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The effect of this check upon the others was instantly noticed. It scared
      them into darting back among the trees, but instead of keeping up their
      flight they whisked behind the trunks, from which they continued to launch
      their arrows at the men in the boat.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>Now, if the Indians, who
      certainly numbered a hundred, had done any one of several things, it would
      have proved a bad day for our friends. It is strange that the red men did
      not wait a few minutes longer until the four stepped ashore. Then, from
      behind the trees, they could have brought them down without danger to
      themselves. Or, if when they made their rush they had kept on, they might
      have leaped aboard the barge and crushed the defenders. Perhaps they did
      not know that after the white men had fired their terrible weapons it took
      some time to reload them. Be that as it may, they fell back, and the
      chance that the invaders needed was given them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      No one could have shown more bravery than Bertram and Smith. They plied
      the poles, paying no regard to the missiles flying around them; while
      their companions, first firing the guns of the couple, reloaded and
      discharged their own as fast as the chance offered. When the craft reached
      the middle of the broad space little was to be feared from the Indians,
      for the distance was too great for them to gain good aim.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was at this moment that a strange thing took place. The clothes of
      every one of the defenders had been pierced by arrows-some in several
      places, and two had been wounded, though not severely. No one <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>could have been more exposed than
      Bertram, standing out as he did in full view while helping to pole the
      boat. He was glazed more than once by the missiles, but was the only one
      of the four who was not so much as scratched. Smith had been hit, but was
      smiling over his good fortune, when he pitched forward on his face,
      pierced to the heart by an arrow that was among the last fired at the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The body was tenderly laid at the stern, and then, while two were alert
      with their weapons, the third used the oars. There was no thought now of
      staying where they were until Captain Smith came back. They did not
      believe he ever would come back. So they kept on down stream as best they
      could. Fortunately for them the large body of Indians did not follow along
      the banks; and with the help of the current, after passing the
      obstructions below, they made good progress. In due course they glided out
      of the mouth of the Chickahominy into the James, and, reaching Jamestown,
      told their story. Among the settlers there was not one who expected ever
      to see Captain John Smith or his companions again.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Meanwhile the Captain was having stirring times. You remember that he set
      out to go still farther up the stream in the little boat, which was just
      bouyant enough to <span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>carry him,
      the two white men, and the friendly Indians. Its light draught made the
      work so easy that they kept on for a dozen miles before meeting their
      first check. The party heard the faint reports of the guns of their
      friends left behind in the barge. Smith thought it more than likely they
      were in trouble, but he had no idea of going to their help, since no one
      but themselves was to blame.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      About noon he reached a point where he saw the little boat had become
      useless. He suspected the truth: he had strayed from the river itself, and
      was following one of its branches. He did not care for that; but telling
      the oarsman to turn to the left bank, all stepped out, and the boat was
      drawn up nearly clear of the water.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You are weary from rowing," he said to the two who had taken turns at the
      hard work; "and you may wait here while I go a little farther in quest of
      game."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Can't we help you?" asked one, who added that they were not tired. Both
      would have been glad to take part in the hunt.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      I have said that Captain Smith was fond of hunting alone, and he told his
      friends to stay where they were. He meant to be with them before dark,
      when they could broil the game which he was sure of bagging, and <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_262">262</span>they would spend the night in
      comfort by the camp fire in the depth of the forest.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Despite what the men said they were quite worn out from rowing the boat
      for several miles. So, with the help of a flint and steel, they kindled a
      big fire, wrapped their blankets around them, and lay down with their feet
      toward the blaze. By and by they sank into deep, restful sleep, for the
      air was nipping and cold, and they were well guarded against the chill.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It grieves me to say that neither of them ever awoke. At the end of an
      hour, while they lay dreaming, the same party of Indians that had attacked
      the larger boat came upon them, and quickly ended their lives.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Now, I need not remind you that in England, like all other countries
      governed by a monarch, the eldest son comes to the throne on the death of
      the ruler. Should King Edward die-and we all hope he will not be called
      away for a long time to come-the Prince of Wales, who is his eldest son
      living, would become the sovereign, and in the event of <i>his</i> death,
      his eldest son would inherit the crown. Such is the rule of descent in
      Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was not thus with Powhatan, the Emperor of many tribes of red men. The
      next heir to his throne, if we may call it such, was his eldest brother.
      If he had had <span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>no brothers,
      the descent would have passed to the sons of Powhatan's sisters. But
      Powhatan had several brothers, and one was Opecancanough. If he outlived
      Powhatan and the eldest brother he would become Emperor. I may say that
      this chief did become ruler, and lived to be nearly a hundred years old.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Opecancanough never liked the English, and he urged Powhatan and his
      fellow warriors to destroy them before their numbers became too great to
      be overcome. He was active and had much to do with the enmity the older
      brother often showed to the settlers. He was the leader of the band which
      attacked the large boat, when one of the white men was killed and the
      others had a narrow escape.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Opecancanough was pursuing Captain John Smith. He knew he was the leading
      man at Jamestown, and that it was more important to slay him than to put
      twenty other Englishmen out of the way. When he learned of the voyage up
      the Chickahominy he gathered more than a hundred of his warriors, and
      secretly followed the boat for many miles, watching for a chance to
      destroy the crew, but especially to slay Captain Smith. It proves how
      cunning he was that he did this for many miles without any of the white
      men learning the fact. The <span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>two
      who exchanged shots with the crew did not belong to his party, though they
      afterwards joined it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A strange fact which it is hard to understand, was, that when Captain John
      Smith and his companions started up the branch of the Chickahominy they
      were not seen by either the chief or any of his band. The Indians were on
      the other side of the broad expanse of the water, and were not looking for
      anything of that nature; but it is singular, indeed, that some of them did
      not observe the departure of the small craft with its five occupants.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the barge began working toward shore, Opecancanough believed Smith
      and his friends were on board. His eagerness to slay them led to a haste
      in the attack, which was the means of saving all except one man. During
      the fight the chief discovered that five of the crew, including the
      Captain, were absent. He must have noticed also, that, the small row boat
      which had been towed at the stern was gone. These facts told him the
      truth: Captain Smith had started up stream with four companions, who were
      already quite distant.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      If the chief had made a bad slip in the first case, he now met with a
      piece of good fortune, due to the fine woodcraft of himself and his
      warriors. A study of the different <span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>outlets
      of the expanse of water showed where a slight disturbance was caused by
      the passage of the small boat. These signs became clearer as they pressed
      along the shore, and left no doubt that they were on the right course.
      Thus it came about that they arrived at the camp where the two white men
      lay asleep with no dream of danger. After the fatal halt it remained for
      the Indians to push on after Captain Smith, who had started to shoot some
      fowl or game for the supper of himself and friends.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      From this point it was necessary to trail the Captain. It was not hard to
      do so, since he could not go through the forest without leaving the prints
      of his shoes, which were as easy to follow as if he had been walking over
      a dusty road. You must remember, too, that he had two companions in the
      persons of the friendly Indians. I have said that there is no knowing
      whether they were true to the leader or not. I cannot help doubting the
      loyalty of one of them, and think you will soon agree with me.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith had no thought of danger. The fact that he had come thus far
      in the wilderness without harm led him to think that what had seemed to
      threaten him once or twice on the way had passed, and he need feel no
      alarm. Only one incident, after he had gone a little way, caused
      misgiving. He <span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>kept the lead;
      the Indians following him in single file, as is their custom. With his
      musket resting on one shoulder, the sturdy fellow tramped forward,
      sometimes turning to the right or left to avoid a dense growth of
      underbrush, or pool, or marsh. He was peering among the branches of the
      trees and along the ground in front and on either hand in quest of game,
      and grew impatient because he did not discover any. With a half-angry word
      upon his lips he suddenly saw a movement among the trees a little to the
      left, which he knew was caused by some animal. Uttering a guarded "<i>Sh!</i>"
      to his companions, he stopped short and looked keenly at the point where
      he had seen the slight flutter.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The next moment he caught the outlines of a noble buck stalking among the
      trees, with his side turned towards the hunter, whom, of course, he did
      not see, though he was sure to detect him in a twinkling. Afraid that one
      of the Indians might not understand the delicate situation, Captain Smith
      turned his head to whisper a warning.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As he did so he saw only one of his men. He who had been walking at the
      rear was gone. The discovery caused such a thrill of distrust that Captain
      Smith forgot the buck moving a little way from him, and asked:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>"Where is Pete?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      He used the name he had given the fellow in place of his difficult native
      title. Jim, as the second was called, flashed his head about, and seemed
      as much astonished as the white man. He answered in his own tongue:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He was walking behind me; I do not know what has become of him."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Both glanced among the trees to the right and left and the rear, without
      seeing anything of the missing one. A crashing noise made them turn to the
      front. It was caused by the buck, which having observed the hunter, was
      off like the wind. No danger of his serving for a meal that evening.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain turned round again. Jim was standing with his back to him, his
      long bow in his left hand, while his profile showed over the right and
      then over the left shoulder as he searched for his late comrade. It looked
      as if he was as much puzzled as the white man. If so, we must believe he
      was loyal to the Captain, though we cannot think the same of the other.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith was angry. Before he could express his feelings he saw directly
      beyond Jim a disturbance among the trees, so similar to what he had
      noticed a short time before, that he thought it came from a similar cause,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>and that the game he was
      seeking was within his reach.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But he was mistaken. While he was looking an Indian appeared, coming
      cautiously toward him. Then another showed on the right of the red man, a
      third on his left, and beyond, around and among these the stained faces
      and dangling hair of others were quickly revealed, with still more coming
      into view. A band was approaching the startled Captain, who knew he was
      caught in a bad plight. The party which had slain three of his friends and
      had been pursuing him over so long a distance had caught with him at last.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The leaders of the Indians were almost as quick to discover their man as
      he had been to see them. A score of signals passed from one to the other,
      and the band pressed towards the Captain, who held his ground. Smith said
      there were three hundred of them, but it must have been less, though they
      were numerous enough to show that little or no hope remained to him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That there should be no doubt as to their intentions, fully a score sent
      their arrows hurtling among the trees and branches at the white man. Some
      went wild and clipped off the twigs near him, but two of them nipped his
      clothing. He fixed his eye on the foremost Indian, who had come near
      piercing him with his missile, and noting <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_269">269</span>that he was in the act of fitting a second one to
      his string, he took careful aim at the warrior and shot him dead.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      During these stirring moments Jim stood as if so overcome that he was
      unable to move or speak. Although he held a fine bow in one hand and his
      quiver was full of arrows, he made no attempt to use them. It was too much
      to expect him to assail his own race, when there was no chance of helping
      the white man by doing so. Captain Smith did not ask him thus to seal his
      own fate, but his own quick wit saw a way in which he might be made to aid
      him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Two strides brought the Captain so near that he could have touched the
      back of his dusky friend, who still seemed dazed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Stand where you are! Don't move!" commanded Smith, in his most impressive
      voice. "They won't shoot through you to reach me!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain was a larger man than his shield, and he took a crouching
      pose, peeping over each shoulder in turn and around the sides of Jim at
      his enemies, who were baffled for the moment. While doing so Smith
      carefully reloaded his musket. It was hard to pound the powder in place
      with the ramrod, shove the bullet after it, and then pour the grains into
      the pan, for, while thus occupied, he had to "keep one eye" on his foes.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Despite the trying situation of Captain Smith, he managed to reload his
      gun, and at the same time to keep his body quite well shielded by that of
      his dusky friend. Several causes made it possible to do this. Jim showed a
      real desire to help his master, for, when it would have been easy to break
      from him and join his countrymen, he allowed himself to be handled at will
      by the white man. The warriors showed by their actions that they did not
      wish to hurt Jim. More than once, when one of them had drawn his
      bow-string and pointed the arrow, he held it back, seeing that if he
      should discharge it he was likely to hurt the man who stood in front of
      the crouching Englishman. More than all, however, was the dread which the
      band, large as it was, felt of the fearful weapon that had stretched one
      of their number lifeless on the ground. Most of them tried to keep the
      trunks of the trees between them and him, even when aiming their primitive
      weapons. Smith had only to turn the muzzle of his musket towards the most
      daring of his <span class="pageno" id="Page_271">271</span>enemies to make
      them dodge back to their protection and cringe in fear.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain saw that the right course was not to fire until he had to do
      so to save himself. So long as his assailants knew that their leader was
      sure to fall they would hold back. How long this would last remained to be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Now, it is hard to think of a situation more hopeless than that of Captain
      Smith at this time. When attacked, his back was toward the camp where he
      had left his two companions some time before. He hoped to be able to
      retreat until he joined them, when the three with their firearms might be
      able to hold off their foes. But it was quite a way to the camp, and he
      could not believe he would be permitted to reach it. His foes were so
      numerous that by spreading out they would be able soon to surround him. He
      could not protect himself from all sides by the body of Jim. It would seem
      that the best and only thing for him to do was to surrender before he had
      increased the enmity of the Indians by slaying more of them.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Standing close behind Jim, he gave his orders in a low voice. After he had
      reloaded his gun he grasped his friend's girdle at the lower part of his
      back, and jerked upon it when ready to retreat a few steps.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Step slowly," he said, "keep with me. Not too slow!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_272">272</span>In this way the withdrawal
      was kept up till they had gone several rods. Smith glanced to the right
      and left, and saw that his enemies were spreading apart, so as to surround
      him. He must prevent this, or it would soon be all over with him. In
      truth, the position of the Indians would be better for themselves when
      they had formed a semicircle than after the circle was completed; for an
      arrow discharged from directly behind Smith would be liable to hit Jim, in
      the line of its flight, while the danger of doing this was less if fired
      from either the right or left.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      You do not need to be told that Captain John Smith was one of the bravest
      of men, and he would fight as long as the slightest hope was left to him.
      When he had doubled the distance named he began to think that he might
      reach the camp of his companions and beat off his assailants, who felt
      such a dread of his gun. But while doing so, with Jim still serving the
      part of shield, he saw that the danger he had in mind at first had come
      upon him. One warrior, more than six feet in height, with his face stained
      with puccoon, and his crown stuck full of dyed eagle feathers, had worked
      so far to the right of the white man that the latter could not screen
      himself behind his friend without inviting a shot from most of the others.
      Smith was able to keep <span class="pageno" id="Page_273">273</span>his
      chief foe in his field of vision while watching the actions of the main
      party.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This warrior must have had a clear plan in mind, for, darting from one
      tree to another and holding his arrow, he gained the advantage he was
      seeking. In order to make his aim certain he stepped from behind the trunk
      which had sheltered him, and carefully sighted at the slowly retreating
      Englishman. Before he could draw the shaft to a head he uttered a loud
      cry, leaped high in air, and pitched forward with his long bow bent under
      him. Smith had fired again, and not a second too soon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The shot was so unexpected that the warriors were checked for a minute.
      Smith expected it, and, standing behind Jim, hastily reloaded his musket.
      No harder situation can be thought of, for it was certain that his foes
      would soon rally, and press him closer than before. With a coolness that
      was amazing, he poured the powder into the pan of his gun from his horn,
      grasped the weapon firmly, and took a couple of steps to the rear.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Come on, Jim," he said, having loosed his hold. "Keep moving till I tell
      you to stop."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was at this juncture that Smith made a startling discovery. One of the
      Indians-he who stood nearest the one that had just fallen-had an English
      musket in his hands! <span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>Less
      than ten paces from him a second warrior held a similar weapon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith knew what it meant; his two friends whom he had left in camp had
      been slain. He had no one now to fall back upon.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Even the brave Englishman did not then yield. He would have continued
      retreating and fighting until brought to the ground. Nor did he give up
      when one of the arrows, better aimed than the others, pierced his thigh,
      and made a slight wound. He noticed that his comrade who had served him so
      well thus far had also been hit. His countrymen were growing impatient
      because he kept them back so long, and were beginning to launch their
      shafts with less care for his safety. His life would not be spared unless
      he stepped aside.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      With a chivalry for which Captain Smith deserved the highest credit, he
      pushed his friend so strongly to one side that he had to take several
      paces to keep from falling.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Thank you, Jim; you can serve me no longer."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain retreated faster, with his eyes on his enemies, meaning to
      hold his fire as long as he could, but ready to use the musket the instant
      it was needed. Afraid that he would soon be surrounded, he paid no heed to
      Jim, who paused a little way from him, and stared around as if bewildered.
      The Englishman could not look where he placed his feet.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>The right foot went down on
      the ground, but instead of finding the firm support it had had all along,
      the leg sank to the knee in the soft mud. Smith made a desperate effort to
      wrench it free, when the left foot went down as far as the other. He
      struggled with might and main, but sank farther, until both legs were
      imbedded in the ooze almost to his thighs.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This brought the end. It seemed to him that the clinging mud was colder
      than ice itself. He must perish, even if the Indians left him alone, and
      they were sure not to do that. He flung his musket from him, and threw up
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I yield! I surrender!" he called in the tongue of the red men.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Even then, when his helpless situation was plain to all, most of the
      warriors were afraid to draw nearer to him. All knew him as the most
      important member of the colony, and what they had seen him do filled them
      with dread of the great magician. Fortunately, there were a few with more
      sense. They went to where Smith was still floundering and grasping his
      outstretched hands, drew him out upon hard ground.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Captain had learned from his experience among these people. He knew
      their weak side. In a voice of authority, he asked as he looked around in
      the stained faces, for their chief. At the same time he took hold <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_276">276</span>of a small compass in an ivory
      case, which he earned at his side. Deftly untying the string, he held the
      little instrument in his hand, so that all could see the tiny needle
      flickering back and forth under the glass covering. They crowded around
      like so many children, gaping in wonder, and not knowing whether to
      retreat or hold their ground.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Finally, one braver than the others, timidly reached his forefinger and
      tried to place it on the dancing needle. But lo! something stopped the
      finger point before it touched the restless bit of metal. With a gasp of
      affright the warrior recoiled, ignorant of what it meant.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      That which had checked his action was the thin covering of glass. Not one
      of the Indians had ever beheld the metal, and the bit before the curious
      one was so transparent that he did not see even that. Those of his people
      who had visited Jamestown observed the windows protected with oiled paper.
      Glass was before them for the first time.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Only one of the Indians was brave enough thus to try to touch the magnetic
      needle, and despite the shock he received, he tried it again, only to be
      repulsed as before. He bent his head farther over the compass, as if he
      suspected the hard substance which stopped him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      His head almost touched the chin of Captain Smith. The latter looked more
      closely <span class="pageno" id="Page_277">277</span>at him. He saw that,
      while he was dressed much the same as the others, he had more stained
      eagle plumes in his dangling black hair, and he wore a broader and finer
      sash around his waist. Gazing downward, Smith noted also that his leggings
      had numerous ornamental fringes, and there were more beads on his
      moccasin-all these being in the line of the Englishman's vision.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Noting these, it flashed upon Smith that this warrior was the chieftain
      for whom he had asked a few minutes before. At the same moment he
      recognized him. He was Opecancanough, brother of Powhatan, next to him in
      importance, heir to the throne, and a leader who was destined to act an
      important part in the early history of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the sachem straightened up, after he had learned why he could not
      touch the needle, Smith offered the compass to him. He smiled and shook
      his head. His courage was not yet sufficient to take the marvellous thing
      in his palm. He looked into the face of the Captain, as did all the
      others, who crowded round, as if inviting him to tell them something about
      the instrument.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In describing this odd incident Captain Smith relates something which,
      with all our fondness for the good fellow, we cannot quite believe. He
      says that by means of the compass he demonstrated the roundness of the
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_278">278</span>earth, the skies, the sphere
      of the sun, moon, and stars; "and how the sunne did chase the night round
      the world continually; the greatnese of the land and sea; the diversitie
      of nations; varietie of complexions, and how we were to them, antipodes,
      and many other such matters."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Perhaps the lecture was given as described, but little or nothing of it
      was understood by his hearers. In the first place, his knowledge of their
      tongue was slight, and the facts themselves were profound. But by this
      time Smith was in a bad condition. He was smeared with icy mud to his
      waist, and so chilled that his teeth chattered. His captors showed
      unexpected kindness. They rubbed the stuff from his clothes, and led him
      back to the camp where his dead friends lay. The fire was burning
      strongly, and he was soon able to warm himself.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But Smith had killed two of the warriors, and when the others had had time
      to recover from the spell of his seeming magic they talked together. After
      all, he was a man the same as themselves, though the color of his skin was
      different, and he did not dress like them. They were so numerous that he
      gave up all thought of resistance, since his weapons were in their hands,
      and they enclosed him on all sides. Two of them came forward, each taking
      him by an arm, and led him to a tree, <span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>to
      which he was bound with deer thongs. Then the company formed a circle, and
      each Indian slowly drew an arrow to its head, with the point levelled at
      him. Smith closed his eyes, and uttered a prayer to heaven.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Opecancanough was not among those who thus made ready to bury the missiles
      in his body. He stood a little apart from the others, and before they
      could launch their deadly arrows he commanded them in a loud voice to
      stop. At the same moment he held up the compass, which he had at last
      taken from the captive. His men were prompt in obeying, and all lowered
      their weapons.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hope was renewed in the breast of Smith, though he could not help fearing
      that his death had been merely postponed. His captors knew who he was,
      and, since he had slain two of their number, they would not forgive him,
      even though the Indians had shot three of the whites to death.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The order of march was formed with Opecancanough in the center, and the
      English swords and muskets carried as trophies before him. Next to him
      walked Smith led by two savages, each of whom held one of his arms, while
      on either side marched six in single file.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Thus the procession moved through the forest till it reached Orapakes, a
      hunting home of Powhatan, on the northern side of Chickahominy Swamp. This
      village contained <span class="pageno" id="Page_280">280</span>about two
      score mat houses. The women and children swarmed out of the dwellings and
      stared in amazement at the prisoner, the like of whom few had ever seen
      before. The warriors began a grand war-dance around Smith and
      Opecancanough, who stood in the middle. When the savages had tired
      themselves out they led the prisoner to a large matted wigwam, into which
      he passed, while twenty of the leading Indians mounted guard on the
      outside. Smith was unbound, and he seated himself on a bearskin near the
      entrance to the lodge, wondering what was to come next.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Before long a couple of warriors appeared bearing cooked venison and
      Indian bread, which they placed on the ground before the captive, who was
      so hungry that he ate his fill. After this enough was left for a dozen
      men. His attendants put it into baskets, and swung them from the roof over
      his head, but to Smith's surprise ate nothing themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The wintry afternoon was drawing to a close, and the Captain was so
      exhausted that he stretched out on the bearskin and soon fell asleep. A
      fire had been kindled on the farther side of the wigwam, which so filled
      it with warmth that he was comfortable, though naturally his mind was
      greatly disturbed. Before closing his eyes he saw the shadowy forms of
      men, women and children, who kept coming to the entrance and peeping in.
      The <span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>door consisted of the
      skin of a bear, which was frequently drawn aside, and then the Captain saw
      several pairs of bright eyes studying him. He heard their whispers, after
      which they withdrew, and their places were taken by others as curious as
      they.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      About midnight Smith awoke. Someone threw more wood on the fire, and by
      the light that filled the apartment he saw two others bearing venison and
      bread, which they placed at the head of his couch. The prisoner smiled.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I have eaten enough to last me till tomorrow," he said. "You may take
      this away, and wait till I am hungry again."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But they gave no heed, and, having set down the food, passed softly out
      into the open air.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Why are they feeding me so well?" he asked himself. "They must know I
      have had my fill-and therefore do not need any more-"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A dreadful suspicion flashed over him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "They are fattening me like a pig, so that I shall be in good condition
      for them to eat!"

        CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">THE FRIEND IN NEED</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Now, if a boy, while eating a fine dinner, should suddenly form the belief
      that the men who gave the food to him meant it to make him plumper, so
      that he would form a better dinner for <i>them</i>, I am sure he would not
      have much appetite left. Captain John Smith came to this belief not many
      hours after finishing a bountiful meal provided by his Indian captors, and
      he made up his mind not to eat another mouthful. If they meant to feast
      upon their prisoner, they should find him in the poorest condition
      possible.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It is easy for anyone to form such a resolve when he has no craving for
      food, but with the next morning it seemed to Smith that he was never
      hungrier in his life. And there were two big baskets of pone and venison.
      After thinking over the question he decided that he might as well eat what
      was set before him, and begin his fasting after that. By and by it was not
      hard to persuade himself that it would really make no difference as to
      what would be finally done with him. So he gave over all thought of
      punishing himself by <span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>going
      hungry when there was nothing to be gained by it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The Indians spared his life so long that Captain Smith began to hope they
      would let him return to Jamestown. When he was taken before a sick man he
      told the friends he could get his medicine at the settlement that would
      make the patient well, but they were too cunning to let him go after it.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The next proposal of his captors was that he should help them in
      destroying Jamestown. They told him nothing could save the place, for the
      tribes had determined not to allow a white man to remain alive. They
      promised to give Smith all the lands he could ask, with liberty to choose
      as many wives as he pleased. He assured the Indians that it was out of
      their power to hurt the settlement, and that those who tried to do so
      would suffer awful consequences. His words produced the effect he
      intended, and the plan was given up.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith next did a thing that filled the red men with astonishment. He tore
      a leaf from his pocket-book, and with a piece of red chalk, whittled to a
      point, he wrote several sentences. Holding up the slip with the writing on
      it, he said to the staring warriors:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "The words I speak to you have been put on this paper; they ask my friends
      at Jamestown to give you the articles which I name. Let some of your
      messengers take this to <span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>Jamestown
      and show it to my people there, and you will see that I have spoken with a
      single tongue."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Not believing what he said, two of fleetest runners set out for the
      settlement. It was the depth of winter, when there was a good deal of snow
      on the ground, and the weather was very cold. But the messengers made the
      journey, and handed the paper to the persons there, who straightway gave
      them the trifling articles called for, to the unbounded astonishment of
      the runners, who could not understand how the strange thing was done.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It need hardly be said that the paper contained more on it than the writer
      had read to the Indians. He told his friends of the plan of the red men to
      destroy the place, and urged upon them to use the utmost diligence against
      surprise. In order to impress their dusky visitors, the settlers fired
      several of their cannon among the ice-laden trees. The shots made a great
      racket, and sent the branches and bits of ice flying in all directions.
      When the runners came back to their people and told what they had seen,
      and proved that the prisoner had really spoken by means of the paper to
      his friends many miles away, their amazement was beyond words.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Now followed several weeks during which Captain Smith was on exhibition.
      He was paraded through the country, with crowds <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_285">285</span>swarming to look at him, as we do in these times
      when some new and strange animal is shown in the museums. No harm was
      offered him, but he could never feel secure against death, and he was
      always looking for a chance to escape. Not once, however, did he dare make
      the attempt. His captors were so watchful that he knew he must fail, and
      they would be sure to punish him, probably by slaying him at once.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      During these troublous times Smith kept looking for Pocahontas or her
      brother Nantaquas. They must have known of the kindness he had shown the
      girl, and it would seem that gratitude would lead them to do all they
      could for him. But he saw nothing of either. His excursions were through
      the lands that were directly ruled by Opecancanough. The old Indian
      capital was on York River, about twenty-five miles below the present
      village of West Point. The spot was known as the "Chief Place of Council,"
      the Indian name being Werowocomoco.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Finally, as if Opecancanough could not decide for himself what should be
      done with the captive, who had been exhibited through the country, he was
      taken to Werowocomoco, before the mighty Powhatan himself. There the great
      question was to be settled by the most powerful Emperor of all the
      Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The scene was striking. The tall, glum, <span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>haughty
      Powhatan sat on a framework or couch, suggestive of a throne, covered with
      mats, and in front of a large fire. He was wrapped in a robe of raccoon
      skin. On each side sat a young woman who was his wife, and along the sides
      of the royal lodge stood two rows of men, with the same number of women
      standing directly behind them. The faces and shoulders of all the females
      were stained red, most of their heads were adorned with white down, and
      strings of white beads were around their necks. It was fortunate for the
      women that such a large fire was burning in the wigwam, for they had very
      scant covering on their bodies.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As Captain Smith was brought before this imposing company, naturally he
      was filled with wonder as to what the end would be. He knew that the grim,
      gaunt Emperor was about to decide his fate-or, rather, would make it
      known, for the prisoner had been led thither to hear his sentence.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      As the Captain made a grave obeisance to Powhatan he cast searching looks
      around the lodge in quest of Pocahontas and her brother Nantaquas, and saw
      the latter. He was standing on the right of the Emperor, at the head of
      the double line of warriors, which was the place of honor. All these men
      had their weapons with them. Knives and tomahawks showed in their girdles,
      and the end <span class="pageno" id="Page_287">287</span>of each bow, as
      tall as themselves, rested on the floor, being grasped around the thick
      portion in the middle.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Smith noticed that the stature of Nantaquas was the equal of the warrior
      next to him, though, in truth, he was only a boy. His eyes met those of
      Smith, but there was not the slightest change of expression. Whatever his
      feelings might be, the youth dared give no sign in the presence of his
      stern father.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But where was Pocahontas? Twice, Smith searched hurriedly among the group,
      all of whom he saw despite the rows in front, but that fair, pitying face
      was not among them. The prisoner's heart sank. He gave up hope. A woman
      known as the "Queen of Appomattox" was ordered to bring a wooden bowl of
      water, in which he washed his hands. Another woman handed him a soft bunch
      of feathers, which he used as a towel. After this came a barbarous feast
      for the hapless captive, and then a long consultation.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It is probable that Powhatan and his brother chiefs would have spared
      Captain Smith, but for the fact that he had slain two of their number.
      That was an offence which could not be forgiven, and he was sentenced to
      death. Two warriors appeared at the entrance of the lodge, each bearing a
      heavy stone. It was the most they could do to carry them to the open space
      in front of the <span class="pageno" id="Page_288">288</span>chieftain,
      where they were laid on the ground, beside each other.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At a sign from Powhatan half a dozen of his men sprang to where Smith
      stood, watching the dreadful preparations. He was dragged and pushed
      forward, his hands tied behind his back and then flung to the ground, and
      his head forced down, so that it rested on the larger of the two stones.
      He did not resist, for this man of so many strange adventures felt that
      the last of them all had come.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Hardly had his head been placed on the rough support, when most of the
      warriors fell away, leaving one ranged on either side of the prostrate
      captive. These stood near his shoulders, and each grasped a huge club, the
      large end swinging clear of the ground, in position for them to draw it
      back and bring it down on the head of Smith with such force that no second
      blow on the part of either would be needed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was an awful moment. Intense silence reigned in the lodge. No one
      seemed to breathe, and only the soft rustle of the fire and the moaning of
      the wintry wind outside the wigwam broke the stillness. The position of
      everyone was rigid, and all eyes were fixed upon the captive and his
      executioners. Not a sign of pity showed on the face of anyone. The
      countenance of Powhatan was like that of a graven image, but his black
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_289">289</span>eyes gleamed. To him the
      tragedy was one of fine enjoyment. He did not give any command or speak,
      for it was not needed. The couple with the clubs knew their duty.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At this moment of tense emotion a movement was heard on the left of the
      Emperor, and just behind the wife who was standing at the head of the row.
      With a gasping exclamation, Pocahontas dashed between the men in front of
      her, thrusting them out of her path, and, bounding like a fawn across the
      intervening space, dropped on one knee, placed an arm on either side of
      the Captain's head, and with tears streaming down her cheeks, looked up at
      her father.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You must not kill him! He is my friend! He was kind to Pocahontas! Spare
      his life, dear father, for <i>me</i>!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      No one moved or spoke. Powhatan glared angrily at his daughter for neither
      she nor anyone had ever dared to do a thing like this before. Had it been
      anyone else, he would have struck the person dead at his feet.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But he could not raise his hand against the loved child of his heart. He
      started to rise, but changed his mind and sank back again. The
      executioners looked at him, awaiting his command, and paying no attention
      to the girl kneeling between them, with her arms still about the neck of
      Captain Smith, who looked up into her dark, pitying <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_290">290</span>eyes. A warm tear fell on his bronzed forehead.
      With one hand Pocahontas brushed back the heavy brown hair which had
      dropped over his eyes, and smiling through her grief, said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "You shall not be harmed! Your life is spared!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "How can you know that, my good friend?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Do you not see?" she asked in turn, grasping one of his bound arms above
      the elbow, as if to help him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      At this moment Captain Smith saw what she meant by her question. The
      warriors with their huge clubs had stepped away from the two. Powhatan
      could not deny the prayer of Pocahontas, and had signalled to them to
      spare the life of the white man.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the Captain stood erect, his face flushed with embarrassment. Not
      knowing what to do, he did nothing, but stood with his eyes on the ground.
      Pocahontas fluttered about him like a bird. She tried to untie the knots
      that bound his wrists behind his back, and though she would have succeeded
      in a few minutes, she was impatient. She beckoned to her brother
      Nantaquas, who came hastily forward and cut the thongs with his knife. He
      turned inquiringly to Powhatan, who motioned for his son to take the man
      away. Clasping the hand of the prisoner in his own, the youth led him
      through the door to the <span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>outside
      of the wigwam. Pocahontas did not follow, but did another thing that
      astonished the group gathered round. Forgetful of all kingly dignity in
      the stress of her feelings, she bounded to the throne, flung her arms
      about the neck of her parent, and laying her head on the gaunt shoulder,
      sobbed with thankfulness, murmuring words which only Powhatan could hear.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      And for the moment he forgot that he was King. He stroked the masses of
      black hair until she regained command of herself, when he told her in a
      low voice that he had spared the prisoner because he could deny nothing to
      the one who asked it. She faced about with glowing countenance, on which
      the tears still shone, and moved back to the place she had held before
      doing the noble act.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Meanwhile Nantaquas guided Captain Smith to his own lodge, which stood at
      the eastern end of the village. It was small, for only he dwelt there. It
      was hardly a dozen feet in length, and no more than two-thirds of that in
      width, but a fire was smouldering at the farther end, the skins of animals
      were spread on the ground, and his favorite bow leaned in one corner. On
      the ridge pole of the wigwam were hung the furs of bears, deer, and wolf.
      Primitive as was the dwelling, it was as comfortable as it could be.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Captain Smith was not a "gushing" man. <span class="pageno" id="Page_292">292</span>In
      this respect he was like Nantaquas. The Indian youth had learned the white
      men's custom of greeting one another by shaking hands. When the Captain,
      therefore, offered his hand to his friend, it was grasped by him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I shall always be thankful to you, Nantaquas."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Your thanks belong to my sister," was the gentle reply.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I know that, and she will ever dwell in my heart. Does this mean that my
      life is spared for a short time only?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I will learn; wait till I come back."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Lifting the flap of the lodge, the dusky youth slipped outside. Captain
      Smith sat down on one of the furs spread on the floor, and gave himself
      over to thinking of the strange things that had come to him in the past.
      He was sitting thus, sunk in meditation, when his friend returned.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nantaquas had talked with Powhatan, who told him that Smith was to stay
      among the Indians, and give his time to the making of moccasins, bows and
      arrows, robes and pots, and especially to the manufacture of beads, bells,
      and copper trinkets for Pocahontas. The Captain accepted the proposal with
      great pleasure, for he knew that the end, sooner or later, would be his
      return to Jamestown. What a contrast between the many stormy scenes he had
      passed through and this quiet <span class="pageno" id="Page_293">293</span>toiling
      in the depths of the American woods! He took up the task with the same
      energy he put in everything, and pleased Nantaquas; who showed a real
      friendship for him. Powhatan was also well satisfied, and Pocahontas, who
      often came to the little workshop and watched the sturdy Captain at labor,
      was delighted. She would sometimes sit for a long time on a mat in front
      of him, noting with childish interest the movements of the sturdy fingers
      that were more used to handling the sword than to fashioning the delicate
      ornaments and trinkets. She could not restrain her happiness as the
      articles gradually took form. When the Captain completed a pair of
      moccasins that were as dainty as the slippers of Cinderella, she slipped
      them on her feet, clapped her hands, and danced about the wigwam, just as
      any little English or American girl would have done. Nantaquas and Captain
      Smith smiled at the pretty picture, and the brave and good Captain felt
      well rewarded for his trouble. Indeed, could he ever repay this sweet
      daughter of the forest for what she had done for him? He often asked
      himself the question, and the answer was always a soft but earnest "<i>No!</i>"

        CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><span class="c002">CONCLUSION</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="c006">
      Powhatan left no doubt of his friendly feeling towards Captain Smith when,
      six weeks after he started on his voyage up the Chickahominy, the sachem
      allowed him to return under guard to Jamestown. He received a warm welcome
      from his countrymen, and the Indians who had come with him were sent back
      to Powhatan with many presents for themselves, and still more for the
      American Emperor himself.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It is one of the many proofs of the fine character of Captain John Smith
      and of his great service to the colony, that, brief as had been his
      absence, the settlement had reached the verge of ruin. The little church
      had been burned, and the good minister held religious services under the
      trees. Of the more than a hundred men who had come across the ocean a few
      months before, only forty were alive. On the very day that Smith arrived
      at the settlement, the new President Ratcliffe and several of his friends
      had seized the pinnace-the only boat left-and were about to sail for
      England. This was the third attempt of that kind, and it was defeated
      again by Smith, who <span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>would
      have shot every man of them had they not come back to land and
      surrendered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Now, what do you suppose was the next step of those wicked persons? You
      must remember that they had other friends, base as they were. They said
      that under the old Levitical law Smith was guilty of the deaths of the men
      that had been slain by Indians. They would have hanged him on the charge,
      had he not ended the business by arresting his accusers, and warning them
      that, if they caused him any more trouble, he would hang them all.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Woeful times now came to Jamestown. You would think they could be no more
      dreadful than those through which the settlement had already passed, but
      the poor people, besides quarrelling among themselves, began starving to
      death. The gaunt, famished settlers staggered along the single street, too
      feeble to rise when they stumbled and fell. All they could do was to creep
      into their cabins and lie down, moaning and waiting for death to end their
      sufferings. It looked as if not a man would be left alive, and about the
      only one who kept his feet and moved freely about was Captain Smith. He
      was always cheery and hopeful, and helped others by his good spirits,
      which seemed never to leave him.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      But the day came when even this brave man saw no hope. He did not know
      where <span class="pageno" id="Page_296">296</span>to get the next
      mouthful of food without going among the Indians, and his companions were
      too worn and weak to be taken with him. He would not leave them to their
      sad fate, but was ready to die among them, as he had been from the first.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Standing moodily on the outside of the palisades, with arms folded and
      looking off along the trail that led into the forest toward York River, he
      suddenly saw a strange sight. A girl came out from among the trees,
      bearing a basket of corn on her shoulder. He had hardly time to recognize
      her as Pocahontas when he saw she was followed by other Indians. On came
      the procession, until he counted eighteen. The one next to her was
      Nantaquas, and, filing after him, were other warriors, every one of whom
      carried a basket of corn or a haunch of venison. Providence had moved
      their hearts with pity for the perishing white men, and their timely visit
      with food saved them when, but for such kindness, all must have perished.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      No wonder the grateful English ever after referred to the good maiden as
      "the dear and blessed Pocahontas." She came once or twice a week for
      months, bringing supplies through the woods from the York River to
      Jamestown. It was she who took the first step in this good work, and
      Powhatan was willing, for he felt friendly at the time towards <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_297">297</span>the whites. Years after, in a
      letter to the Queen, Captain Smith referred to these acts of Pocahontas in
      the following quaint words:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "During the time of two or three years she next under God, was still the
      instrument to preserve this colony from death, famine, and utter
      confusion, which, if in those days had once been dissolved, Virginia might
      have lain as it was at our first arrival to this day."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      I have not the space to tell you the later history of Virginia. Its
      troubles were by no means ended, and many dark days followed-days when it
      looked as if nothing could save the colony from passing away. I have aimed
      rather to show something of the great services of Pocahontas, daughter of
      Powhatan, who ruled over thirty tribes of Indians, She never showed any
      weakening of her friendship for the white people. Sometimes her father
      became offended with them and went to war, but nothing could shake her
      good will. He even grew angry with her, but, though parent and child could
      not quarrel the maiden only became more guarded in her deeds of kindness,
      when Powhatan happened to be in one of his ugly moods.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      There was a time when the chieftain's enmity against Smith became so deep
      that he used every means he could think of to have him put to death. The
      Captain was ready to fight the Emperor, when nothing else was <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>left. He set out one day with a
      strong company to surprise Powhatan. He had not been gone long when nine
      of those whom he had left at home went out in a boat in a severe storm.
      The craft was capsized and the whole party drowned. Smith had ordered
      these men to hold themselves ready to join him whenever he sent for them.
      It was important that he should be told of the calamity as soon as
      possible, so that his own expedition might not fail through lack of the
      aid he might need.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      The task of reaching Smith through the many miles of wilderness was so
      dangerous that only one man in the colony was willing to make the attempt.
      He was captured by Indians and taken before Powhatan at Werowocomoco, and
      the chieftain ordered him to be put to death. Without drawing suspicion to
      herself, Pocahontas got him a short distance away in the woods, and hid
      him among the bushes. He would have been found and brought back by the
      warriors who set out to search for him had she not cunningly led them in a
      wrong direction. The man gained enough start to join Smith, and tell him
      of the sad accident to the men whom he had counted upon for help.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Some time later, when matters seemed to have quieted, a party of colonists
      went among Powhatan's people to trade, but all except <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_299">299</span>one was massacred. Pocahontas succeeded in saving
      his life, and he lived many years, secure in her friendship, among the
      Indians.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      In 1609 Captain Smith, while on one of his exploring expeditions, was so
      painfully burned by the accidental explosion of a bag of gunpowder, that
      he suffered great agony. Good medical treatment could not be given him at
      Jamestown, and he sailed for England. He never came back to Virginia,
      which was a great misfortune, since no man could be found fitted to take
      his place. Of the five hundred whom he left behind, only sixty were alive
      at the end of six months. History refers to this fearful period of
      Virginia as "the Starving Time."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When, at last, conditions improved through the steady coming of
      immigrants, Captain Argall started on a cruise up James River. He invited
      Pocahontas to visit his vessel, and she, dreaming of no evil, came aboard
      with an Indian woman, who had been bribed to play her part, under the
      promise of Argall that no harm should befall the girl. The woman was
      allowed to go ashore, but Pocahontas was kept as a prisoner. The
      expectation of Argall was that Powhatan would be glad to pay a large
      ransom with corn for her return to him. Instead of doing so, the furious
      sachem prepared to wage a savage war against the colony.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>During these troublous weeks
      Pocahontas stayed at Jamestown, where everyone treated her kindly. John
      Rolfe, a member of a good English family, became interested in the maiden,
      and she returned his affection. He was a good Churchman, and talked to
      Pocahontas about the true religion. She listened with deep interest, and
      soon showed that no one understood the mysteries of the Christian faith
      better than she. She was truly converted, and asked that she might be
      baptized. In the quaint little chapel at Jamestown, whose columns were the
      rough pines from the forest, whose pews were fragrant cedar, and whose
      communion table and pulpit were of black walnut, this Princess of the
      Woods knelt before the font hewn out of a log, made the responses in
      broken English, and received the baptismal name of Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Rolfe and Pocahontas were married in the month of April, 1613. Although
      Powhatan did not attend the ceremony, he cheerfully gave his consent, and
      sent his brother and two of his sons to represent him. One of these was
      our old friend Nantaquas, who was highly pleased with the marriage. The
      uncle of Pocahontas gave her away in accordance with the Anglican ritual.
      The windows of the chapel were festooned with evergreens, wild flowers,
      and crimson hollyberries. The communion table was covered with spotless
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_301">301</span>white linen, and on it rested
      bread from the wheat fields and wine from the native grapes. The settlers
      and Indian visitors crowded the small building, and gazed with deep
      interest upon the beautiful picture.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      When the bride and groom appeared, she was dressed in a simple tunic of
      white muslin, with her comely arms bared to the shoulders. Sir Thomas Dale
      had presented her with a rich robe, which she had herself embroidered. Her
      abundant black hair flowed down her back, and was encircled by a fillet,
      filled with the bright plumage of birds, and holding in its fastenings a
      cloudlike, misty veil. A few simple articles of jewelry gleamed on her
      wrists. Modest, loving, and beautiful, she made a charming bride.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Nor must we forget the groom. He had a manly figure, and with his short,
      full beard, an attractive countenance. He was dressed like an English
      cavalier, and wore a short sword on his thigh as a mark of distinction.
      The two stood upon the chancel steps, which had no railing, and there the
      clergyman, with impressive voice and manner, amid the breathless hush of
      the spectators, made the two man and wife.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      This union was a happy one in every respect. Husband and wife devotedly
      loved each other, and Powhatan became the true friend of the English, and
      so remained to <span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>the close of
      his life. When Governor Dale sailed for England in 1616, he took Rolfe and
      Pocahontas with him. She was called "Lady Rebecca," and surely it was
      proper that she should wear such honor, for was she not the daughter of
      the Greatest American King of his time? She received marked attention from
      the court and leading dignitaries in England, and everything was done to
      make her feel happy in a land so new and strange to her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      It was natural that Pocahontas should feel anxious to meet her old friend
      Captain Smith. He was the first whom she asked about, but, to her grief,
      she was told that he was dead. While mourning for him, the Captain called
      upon her. She was so shocked that she burst into tears, and asked why the
      deception had been used. All sorts of explanations and excuses were made;
      but you will agree with me that none was sufficient to justify such cruel
      treatment.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      She soon regained her cheerfulness, and the two sat down and had a long
      talk over their lives in the land, three thousand miles away, in the depth
      of the American woods. She called the Captain "father," and he returned by
      speaking to her as "daughter."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Since I know you feel an interest in the brave Captain John Smith, I will
      say in this place that he sailed along the coast of New <span
      class="pageno" id="Page_303">303</span>England in 1614, and gave the name
      of Boston to the principal city in that region, besides partially
      exploring the country. He spent his last years in London, engaged in
      writing his histories. He died in 1631, and was buried under the chancel
      of St. Sepulchre's Church. The opening of the poetical inscription is,
      "Here lies one conquered, that hath conquered kings," and the close of the
      prayer is, that "with angels he might have his recompense."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Rolfe and his wife had made ready to sail for the New World, when, at the
      beginning of the year 1617, she fell ill at Gravesend, and died at the age
      of twenty-two years. She left an infant son, Thomas, who was taken to
      London and educated by his uncle, Henry Rolfe. When he reached manhood he
      returned to America, gained a large fortune, and became a gentleman of
      distinction. From him some of the leading families in Virginia today are
      proud to trace their descent.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      By the way, I may add, as an interesting coincidence, the fact that the
      home of <i>Little Folks</i>, "LaBelle Sauvage," was thus named in honor of
      Pocahontas, the "Princess of the Woods."

    <p class="c006">
      <span class="sc">It</span> was a cold night in September. For three days
      the rain had fallen almost unceasingly. It had been impossible for us to
      get out; and no visitors had been in. Everything looked dreary enough, and
      we felt so, truly. Of course the stoves were not prepared for use; and
      this night we (that is, Nell, Floy, Aunt Edna, and myself) were huddled in
      the corners of the sofa and arm-chairs, wrapped in our shawls. We were at
      our wits' end for something to while the hours away. We had read
      everything that was readable; played until we fancied the piano sent forth
      a wail of complaint, and begged for rest; were at the backgammon board
      until our arms ached; and I had given imitations of celebrated actresses,
      until I was hoarse, and Nell declared I was in danger of being sued for
      scandal. What more could we do? To dispel the drowsiness that was stealing
      over me, I got up, walked up and down the floor, and then drew up the
      blind, and gazed out into the deserted street. Not a footfall to be heard,
      neither man's nor beast's; nothing but patter, patter, patter. At length,
      after standing fully fifteen minutes-oh, joyful sound!-a coming footstep,
      firm and quick. My first thought was that those steps would stop at our
      door. But, directly after, I felt that very improbable for who was there
      that <i>would</i> come such a night? Papa was up north with mamma: Nell
      and Floy were visiting Aunt Edna <span class="pageno" id="Page_306">306</span>and
      me, the only ones home, save the servants. Neither of us had as yet a
      lover so devoted or so demented as to come out, if he had anywhere to <i>stay
      in</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      On and past went the steps. Turning away, I drew down the blind, and said:
      "Some one must be ill, and that was the doctor, surely: for no one else
      would go out, only those from direst necessity sent."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      A deep sigh escaped Aunt Edna's lips, and although partially shaded by her
      hand, I could see the shadow on the beautiful face had deepened.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Why my aunt had never married was a mystery to me, for she was lovable in
      every way, and must have been very beautiful in her youth. Thirty-six she
      would be next May-day, she had told me. Thirty-six seemed to me, just
      sixteen, a very great many years to have lived. But aunt always was young
      to us; and the hint of her being an old maid was always resented, very
      decidedly, by all her nieces.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Aunt Edna," I said, "tell us a story-a love-story, please."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, little one, you have read <i>so</i> many! And what can I tell you
      more?" she answered, gently.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh, aunty, I want a <i>true</i> story! Do, darling aunty, tell us your
      own. Tell us why you are blessing our home with your presence, instead of
      that of some noble man, for noble he must have been to have won your
      heart, and-hush-sh! Yes, yes; I know something about somebody, and I must
      know all. Do, please!"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      I plead on. I always could do more with Aunt Edna than any one else. I was
      named for her, and many called me like her-"only not nearly so pretty" was
      always added.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_307">307</span>At last she consented,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Dear girls, to only one before have I given my entire confidence, and
      that was my mother. I scarce know why I have yielded to your persuasions,
      little Edna, save that this night, with its gloom and rain, carries me
      back long years, and my heart seems to join its pleading with yours,
      yearning to cast forth some of its fulness, and perchance find relief by
      pouring into your loving heart its own sorrows. But, darling, I would not
      cast my shadow over your fair brow, even for a brief time."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      With her hand still shading her face, Aunt Edna began:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Just such a night as this, eighteen years ago, dear child, my fate was
      decided. The daughter of my mother's dearest friend had been with us about
      a year. Dearly we all loved the gentle child, for scarcely more than child
      she was-only sixteen. My mother had taken her from the cold, lifeless form
      of her mother into her own warm, loving heart, and she became to me as a
      sister. So fair and frail she was! We all watched her with the tenderest
      care, guarding her from all that could chill her sensitive nature or wound
      the already saddened heart. Lilly was her name. Oh, what a delicate while
      lily she was when we first brought her to our home; but after a while she
      was won from her sorrow, and grew into a maiden of great beauty. Still,
      with child-like, winning ways.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Great wells of love were in her blue eyes-violet hue <i>he</i> called
      them. Often I wondered if any one's gaze would linger on my dark eyes when
      hers were near? Her pale golden hair was pushed off her broad forehead and
      fell in heavy waves far down below her <span class="pageno" id="Page_308">308</span>graceful
      shoulders and over her black dress. Small delicately formed features, a
      complexion so fair and clear that it seemed transparent. In her blue eyes
      there was always such a sad, wistful look; this, and the gentle smile that
      ever hovered about her lips, gave an expression of mingled sweetness and
      sorrow that was very touching. You may imagine now how beautiful she was.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Her mother had passed from earth during the absence of Lilly's father.
      Across the ocean the sorrowful tidings were borne to him. He was a naval
      officer. Lilly was counting the days ere she should see him. The good news
      had come that soon he would be with her. At last the day arrived, but oh!
      what a terrible sorrow it brought! When her heart was almost bursting with
      joy, expecting every moment to be clasped in those dear arms-a telegraphic
      dispatch was handed in. Eagerly she caught it, tore it open, read-and fell
      lifeless to the floor.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Oh! the fearful, crushing words. We read, not of his coming to Lilly, but
      of his going to her, his wife, in heaven. Yes, truly an orphan the poor
      girl was then.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "In vain proved all efforts to restore her to consciousness. Several
      times, when she had before fainted, mother was the only physician needed.
      But that night she shook her head and said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'We must have a doctor, and quickly.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It was a terrible night. Our doctor was very remote. Your father
      suggested another, near by.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Dr. --, well, never mind his name. Your father said he had lately known
      him, and liked him much.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Through the storm he came, and by his skilful <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_309">309</span>treatment Lilly was soon restored to
      consciousness, but not to health. A low nervous fever set in, and many
      days we watched with fearful hearts. Ah! during those days I learned to
      look too eagerly for the doctor's coming. Indeed, he made his way into the
      hearts of all in our home. After the dreaded crisis had passed, and we
      knew that Lilly would be spared to us, the doctor told mother he should
      have to prescribe for me. I had grown pale, from confinement in the
      sickroom, and he must take me for a drive, that the fresh air should bring
      the roses back to my cheeks. Willingly mother consented. After that I
      often went. When Lilly was able to come down-stairs, this greatest
      pleasure of my life then was divided with her. One afternoon I stood on
      the porch with her, waiting while the doctor arranged something about the
      harness.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Oh! <i>how</i> I wish it was my time to go!' she whispered.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Well, darling, it shall be your time. I can go tomorrow. Run, get your
      hat and wraps,' I said, really glad to give any additional pleasure to
      this child of many sorrows.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'No, no, that would not be fair. And, Edna, don't you know that <i>tomorrow</i>
      I would be so sorry if I went today? I do not mean to be selfish, but, oh,
      indeed, I cannot help it! I am wishing <i>every time</i> to go. Not that I
      care for a ride-' She hesitated, flushed, and whispered: 'I like to be
      with my doctor. Don't you, Edna? Oh! I wish he was my father, or brother,
      or cousin-just to be with us all the time, you know.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Just then the doctor came for me, and I had to <span class="pageno"
      id="Page_310">310</span>leave her. As we drove off I looked back and
      kissed my hand to her, saying:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Dear little thing! I wish she was going with us.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'I do not,' the doctor surprised me by saying.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I raised my eyes inquiringly to his. In those beautiful, earnest eyes I
      saw something that made me profoundly happy. I could not speak. After a
      moment he added:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'She is a beautiful, winning child, and I enjoy her company. But when
      with her, I feel as if it was my duty to devote myself entirely to her-in
      a word, to take care of her, or, I should say, to care for <i>her</i>
      only. And this afternoon, of all others, I do not feel like having Lilly
      with us.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "That afternoon was one of the happiest of my life. Although not a word of
      love passed his lips, I knew it filled his heart, and was for me. He told
      me of his home, his relatives, his past life. Of his mother he said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'When you know her, you will love her dearly.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He seemed to be sure that I should know her. And then-ah, well, I thought
      so too, then.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Lilly was waiting for us when we returned. He chided her for being out so
      late. It was quite dark. Tears filled her eyes as she raised them to his
      and said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Don't be angry. I could not help watching. Oh, why did you stay <i>so</i>
      long? I thought you would never come back. I was afraid something had
      happened-that the horse had run away, or-'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Angry I could not be with you, little one. But I don't want you to get
      sick again. Come, now, smile away your tears and fears! Your friend is
      safe and with you again,' the doctor answered."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_311">311</span>Taking her hand, he led her
      into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He had not understood the cause of her tears. Only for him she watched
      and wept.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'<i>Do</i> stay,' she plead, when her doctor was going.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "He told her he could not, then; there was another call he must make, but
      would return after a while.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "She counted the minutes, until she should see him again. Never concealing
      from any of us how dearly she loved him. She was truly as guileless as a
      child of six years.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "From the first of her acquaintance with him, she had declared 'her
      doctor' was like her father. Mother too, admitted, the resemblance was
      very decided.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "This it was, I think, that first made him so dear to her.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Several times, after the doctor returned that evening, I saw he sought
      opportunity to speak to me, unheard by others. But Lilly was always near.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Ah! it was better so. Better that from his <i>own</i> lips I heard not
      those words he would have spoken. Doubly hard would have been the trial.
      Oh, that night when he said, 'good-byee!' He slipped in my hand a little
      roll of paper. As Lilly still stood at the window, watching as long as she
      could see him, I stole away to open the paper. Then, for a while, I forgot
      Lilly, aye, forgot everything, in my great happiness. He loved me! On my
      finger sparkled the beautiful diamond-my engagement ring-to be worn on the
      morrow, 'if I could return his love,' he said.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Quickly I hid my treasures away, his note and the ring-Lilly was coming.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>"She was not yet strong, and
      soon tired. I helped her to get off her clothes, and as she kissed me
      good-night, she said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'I wish we had a picture of him-don't you?'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Who, dear?' I asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'My doctor! Who else? You tease. You <i>knew</i> well enough,' she
      answered, as she nestled her pretty head closer to mine.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Soon she was sleeping and dreaming of him. Sweet dreams at first I knew
      they were; for soft smiles flitted over her face.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I could not sleep. A great fear stole in upon my happiness. Did not Lilly
      love him too? How would she receive the news which soon must reach her?
      Was her love such as mine? Such as is given to but one alone? Or only as a
      brother did she love him? I must <i>know</i> how it was. Heaven grant that
      joy for one would not bring sorrow to the other, I prayed. I had not long
      to wait. Her dreams became troubled. Her lips quivered and trembled, and
      then with a cry of agony she started up.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Gone, gone, gone!' she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "It was many minutes ere I succeeded in calming and making her understand
      'twas but a dream.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Oh, but <i>so</i> real, so <i>dreadfully</i> real. I thought he did not
      care for me. That he had gone and left me, and they told me he was
      married!'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Telling this, she began to sob again.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Lilly, dear, tell me truly-tell your sister, your very best friend-how
      it is you love your doctor?' I asked.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'How?' she returned. 'Oh, Edna, more than all the world! He is all that I
      have lost and more; <span class="pageno" id="Page_313">313</span>and if he
      should die, or I should lose him, I would not wish to live. I <i>could</i>
      not live. He loves me a little, does he not, Edna?'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I could not reply. Just then there was a terrible struggle going on in my
      heart. <i>That</i> must be ended, the victory won ere I could speak. She
      waited for my answer and then said, eagerly:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Oh, speak, <i>do</i>! What <i>are</i> you thinking about?'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Pressing back the sigh-back and far down into the poor heart-I gave her
      the sweet, and kept the bitter part, when I could answer.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Yes, dear, I <i>do</i> think he loves you a little now, and will,
      by-and-by, love you dearly. God grant he may!'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Oh, you darling Edna! You have made me so happy!' she cried, kissing me;
      and still caressing me she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Next morning I enclosed the ring, with only these words:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Forgive if I cause you sorrow, and believe me your true friend. I return
      the ring that I am not <i>free</i> to accept.'
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "I intended that my reply should mislead him, when I wrote that I was not
      free, and thus to crush any hope that might linger in his heart. While at
      breakfast that morning, we received a telegram that grandma was extremely
      ill, and wanted me. Thus, fate seemed to forward my plans. I had thought
      to go away for a while. I told mother all. How her dear heart ached for
      me! Yet she dared not say aught against my decision. She took charge of
      the note for the doctor, and by noon I was on my journey. Two years passed
      ere I returned home. Mother wrote <span class="pageno" id="Page_314">314</span>me
      but little news of either Lilly or her doctor after the first letter,
      telling that my note was a severe shock and great disappointment. Three or
      four months elapsed before grandma was strong enough for me to leave her.
      An opportunity at that time presented for my going to Europe. I wanted
      such an entire change, and gladly accepted. Frequently came letters from
      Lilly. For many months they were filled with doubts and anxiety; but after
      a while came happier and shorter ones. Ah, she had only time to be with
      him, and to think in his absence of his coming again.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "When I was beginning to tire of all the wonders and grandeur of the old
      world, and nothing would still the longing for home, the tidings came they
      were married, Lilly and her doctor, and gone to his western home to take
      charge of the patients of his uncle, who had retired from practice. Then I
      hastened back, and ever since, dear girls, I have been contented, finding
      much happiness in trying to contribute to that of those so dear. Now,
      little Edna, you have my only love-story, its beginning and ending."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "But, aunty, do tell me his name," I said. "Indeed, it is not merely idle
      curiosity. I just feel as if I must know it-that it is for something very
      important. Now you need not smile. I'm very earnest, and I shall not sleep
      until I know. I really felt a presentiment that if I knew his name it
      might in some way affect the conclusion of the story."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Well, my child, I may as well tell you. Dr. Graham it was-Percy Graham,"
      Aunt Edna answered, low.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_315">315</span>"Ah! did I not tell you? It
      was not curiosity. Listen, aunty mine. While you were away last winter,
      papa received a paper from St. Louis; he handed it to me, pointing to an
      announcement. But I will run get it. He told me to show it to you, and I
      forgot. I did not dream of all this."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      From my scrap-book I brought the slip, and Aunt Edna read:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "<span class="sc">Died.</span>-Suddenly, of heart disease, on the morning
      of the 15th, Lilly, wife of Doctor Percy Graham, in the 34th year of her
      age."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Aunt Edna remained holding the paper, without speaking, for some minutes;
      then, handing it back to me, she said, softly, as if talking to her
      friend:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "<i>Dear</i> Lilly! Thank heaven, I gave to <i>you</i> the <i>best</i> I
      had to give, and caused you naught but happiness. God is merciful! Had <i>he</i>
      been taken, and you left, how <i>could</i> we have comforted you?" And
      then, turning to me, she said: "Nearly a year it is since Lilly went to
      heaven. 'Tis strange I have not heard of this."
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "'Tis strange from him you have not heard," I thought; "and stranger still
      'twill be if he comes not when the year is over. For surely he <i>must</i>
      know that you are free-" But I kept my thoughts, and soon after kissed
      aunty good-night.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      One month passed, and the year was out. And somebody was in our parlor,
      making arrangements to carry away Aunt Edna. I knew it was he, when he met
      me at the hall door, and said:
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Edna-Miss Linden! <i>can</i> it be?"
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Yes and no, sir-both-Edna Linden; but, Doctor Graham, not <i>your</i>
      Edna. You will find her in the <span class="pageno" id="Page_316">316</span>parlor,"
      I answered, saucily, glad and sorry, both, at his coming.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Ah, she welcomed him with profound joy, I know. He knew all; papa had told
      him. And if he loved the beautiful girl, he then worshipped that noble
      woman.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      "Thank God! Mine at last!" I heard him say, with fervent joy, as I passed
      the door, an hour after.
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      How beautiful she was, when, a few weeks after, she became his very own. I
      stood beside her and drew off her glove. How happy he looked as he placed
      the heavy gold circlet on her finger! How proudly he bore her down the
      crowded church aisle!
    </p>
    <p class="c014">
      Ah, little Lilly was no doubt his dear and cherished wife. But <i>this</i>
      one, 'twas plain to see, was the one love of his life.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
